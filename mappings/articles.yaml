          \ running instance (virtual machine) with SSH login\nenabled. \n Preparation\
          \ \n You need to create a public/private key pairs before you can use SSH\
          \ to login to\nthe newly created instance. The public will be inserted into\
          \ the instance and\nthe private key is used on your desktop/laptop. \n Windows\
          \ User \n Use PuTTYgen key generator to generate the required key pair.\
          \ \n \n \n Download PuTTYgen (puttygen.exe) from PuTTYgen download page\
          \ \n \n \n Launch the PuTTYgen application by double clicking the puttygen.exe\
          \ \n \n \n Default setting is fine for this case, click the 'Generate' button\
          \ \n \n \n Save your public key by clicking 'Save public key' button. You\
          \ should give a\n name that you can better identify the key in the future\
          \ \n \n \n Save your private key by clicking 'Save private key' button.\
          \ It is the same\n as public key to give a sensible name for future reference.\
          \ Ignore the\n passphrase \n \n \n Linux/Mac User \n Type ssh-keygen in\
          \ console and enter. This generates a public key (id_rsa.pub)\nand a private\
          \ key(id_rsa). By default, the two keys are located in ~/.ssh \n Import\
          \ Public Key \n Public key generated by Windows/Linux/Mac are required to\
          \ be imported into\nNeCTAR cloud dash board before use. \n \n \n Log into\
          \ the dashboard at Cloud Dashboard \n \n \n Go to Access and Security Tab\
          \ and then to the Keypairs page \n \n \n Click 'Import Key Pair' button\
          \ \n \n \n Type in a keypair name and paste the contents of the public key.\
          \ For Windows\n User, open PuTTYgen and click 'Load' button to load the\
          \ related private key and\n copy/paste the public key contents. For Linux/Mac\
          \ user, type cat id_rsa.pub and\n copy/paste the public key contest from\
          \ console output \n \n \n NeCTAR Cloud Dashboard \n Key pairs can also be\
          \ created directly through the NeCTAR Cloud Dashboard. \n \n \n login to\
          \ the dashboard at Cloud Dashboard \n \n \n Go to Access and Security Tab\
          \ and then to the Keypairs page \n \n \n Click 'Create Key Pair' button\
          \ \n \n \n Type in a keypair name in the pop out window and click 'Create\
          \ Key Pair'\n button \n \n \n Save the private key into a directory \n \n\
          \ \n Notes:\nIf you are running a Windows machine the SSH private key may\
          \ need to be\nconverted (use PuTTYgen for converting keys) \n \n \n Open\
          \ PuTTYgen \n \n \n Click 'Load' button to load private key \n \n \n Click\
          \ 'Export OpenSSH key' from 'Conversions' menu \n \n \n Type a private key\
          \ name and save \n \n \n Select an Image \n You need to select an image\
          \ to be used for your instance. The image defines what\noperating system\
          \ the instance uses and thus you need to select an image based on\nyour\
          \ needs. NecTAR Cloud offers a list of predefined official images and for\n\
          simplicity, these images are recommended. You can find a complete list of\n\
          official images from NeCTAR image catalog. You can also find all\navailable\
          \ from Cloud Dashboard. \n \n \n login to the dashboard at Cloud Dashboard\
          \ \n \n \n Go to Dashboard Images tab \n \n \n For advanced users, you can\
          \ also create your own images. Please refer to\nopenstack documentation\
          \ for more details. \n Configure Instance \n Before you can launch a instance,\
          \ you need to configure the below options: \n Details \n \n \n Instance\
          \ Name: your choice of name for the instance to reference in future \n \n\
          \ \n Flavour: the specification of the instance. It gives your number of\
          \ VCPUs,\n size of root disk, size of ephemeral disk and size of RAM. Your\
          \ allocated\n flavour or lesser configurations can be selected (the default\
          \ is m1.small a 1\n CPU machine) \n \n \n Instance Count: number of instance\
          \ to launch (the default is 1) \n \n \n Instance Boot Source: the media\
          \ used to boot the instance. you can boot from\n image, snapshot and volume(the\
          \ default is boot from image) \n \n \n Boot from image: Boot instance using\
          \ an image \n \n \n Boot from snapshot: Boot instance using an snapshot\
          \ \n \n \n Boot from volume: Boot instance from volume storage \n \n \n\
          \ Image Name: the name of an Image. This option depends on instance boot\
          \ source \n \n \n Access & Security \n \n \n Key Pair: the public/private\
          \ keys used to log into the instance. See above to\n see how to create them\
          \ \n \n \n Security Groups: add network access to your instances. This determines\
          \ what\n services can be accessed on the instance. You must select 'SSH'\
          \ Security Groups\n to allow you to login via SSH. If 'SSH' Security Groups\
          \ is not available, you\n can create it by going to Access $ Security tab\
          \ on the right hand side of the\n Cloud Dashboard. The default Security\
          \ Group (no network access at first) is\n pre-selected \n \n \n To create\
          \ a Security Group: \n \n \n login to the dashboard at Cloud Dashboard \n\
          \ \n \n Go to Access & Security tab \n \n \n Click 'Create Security Group'\
          \ button \n \n \n Give a name for the Security Group \n \n \n Give a meaningful\
          \ description for the Security Group \n \n \n Click 'Create Security Group'\
          \ button \n \n \n The newly created Security Group has no rules added(no\
          \ network access defined).\nTo add rules to a Security Group: \n \n \n Go\
          \ to Access $ Security tab \n \n \n Tick to select the Security Group to\
          \ add rules \n \n \n Click 'Manage Rules' button \n \n \n Click 'Add Rule'\
          \ button \n \n \n Select what type of Rule you want to create \n \n \n Select\
          \ Open Port 'Port' to open one single port, Select Open Port 'Port Range'\n\
          \ to open a range of ports \n \n \n Select remote. You specify the source\
          \ of the traffic to be allowed via this\n rule. You may do so either in\
          \ the form of an IP address block (CIDR) or via a\n source group (Security\
          \ Group). \n \n \n Click 'Add' button \n \n \n You can also click 'Delete\
          \ Rule' button to delete a rule \n Availability Zone \n Select the Availability\
          \ Zone for your instance. The Availability Zone is the\nlocation for your\
          \ instance. By default, the system will select an available\nlocation for\
          \ you. You can also click the 'Advanced' button to select a complete\nlist\
          \ of available Availability Zones \n Post-Creation \n You can execute a\
          \ customization script after you launch your instance. You can\ndo any initialization\
          \ and customization to your instance by using this and it\nis executed only\
          \ once at the first boot of your instance. You can copy/paste\nyour script\
          \ by selecting 'Direct Input' or you can upload a script file. The\nscript\
          \ can be shell script or Cloud-init script. \n Advanced Options \n You can\
          \ choose whether you automatic or manual create disk partition. In most\n\
          cases, you shouldn't change the default. \n Notes:\nThe above configuration\
          \ options can be set in the 'Launch Instance' popup\nwindow. To launch the\
          \ popup window, you can to go Dashboard Instances tab and\nclick 'Launch\
          \ Instance' button. \n To get more information about the terms used, please\
          \ refer to\nglossary. \n Launch Instance \n \n \n login to the dashboard\
          \ at Cloud Dashboard \n \n \n Go to Dashboard Instances tab \n \n \n Click\
          \ 'Launch Instance' button \n \n \n Type instance name \n \n \n Select a\
          \ flavour. Flavour indicates the specification of a instance. You can\n\
          \ find more information in the Flavour Details. \n \n \n Select an NeCTAR\
          \ offical image (we suggest selecting a Ubuntu image such as\n NeCTAR Ubuntu\
          \ 14.10 (Utopic) amd64) \n \n \n Click Access & Security tab \n \n \n Select\
          \ a key pair created earlier \n \n \n Select security groups to use. Tick\
          \ 'ssh' and 'http' (these are pre-defined\n group) \n \n \n Click AVailability\
          \ Zone \n \n \n Select the location of your instance or leave as unselected(the\
          \ system will\n auto select available location) \n \n \n Click launch button\
          \ and the page will change to the Instances Tab \n \n \n After a while(usually\
          \ a couple of minutes), your instance will become active\n and will have\
          \ an IP address. The IP address is available in the Instances table \n \n\
          \ \n The launch button begins Cloud provisioning and initialisation of a\
          \ running\ninstance from the selected image and your configuration options.\
          \ The instance\nwill normally pass from status \"Build\" to \"Active\".\
          \ Depending on your image\nsize and cloud activity, the length of time required\
          \ may vary, refresh your\nbrowser to see the status change. Your instance\
          \ will have a public IP address\nand be reachable according to the Security\
          \ Groups selected. \n You can connect to your new instance via\nAccessing\
          \ Your Instance \n If Launch is Unsuccessful \n You may get a message that\
          \ you your quota has been exceeded or you have\ninsufficient resources.\
          \ Check the table to the right on the Launch Instance page\nit lists the\
          \ number of instances you may run simultaneously, then check the\nInstances\
          \ tab to see how many Instances you already have running. You may have\n\
          to terminate a running Instance to free resources before you can launch\
          \ another\n(see Instance tab to Terminate). If you need more resources see\
          \ the allocation\ntab to apply for an increase. \n If the above doesn't\
          \ apply to you, alternatively, you can send an email to the\nCloud Help\
          \ Desk. Please find how to lodge a support ticket from\nNeCTAR Support. "

  html: "<h1>Launching Virtual Machine</h1>\n<p>This guide helps to launch a running\
    \ instance (virtual machine) with SSH login\nenabled.</p>\n<h2>Preparation</h2>\n\
    <p>You need to create a public/private key pairs before you can use SSH to login\
    \ to\nthe newly created instance. The public will be inserted into the instance\
    \ and\nthe private key is used on your desktop/laptop.</p>\n<h3>Windows User</h3>\n\
    <p>Use PuTTYgen key generator to generate the required key pair.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n\
    <p>Download PuTTYgen (puttygen.exe) from <a href=\"http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html\"\
    >PuTTYgen download page</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Launch the PuTTYgen application\
    \ by double clicking the puttygen.exe</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Default setting is\
    \ fine for this case, click the 'Generate' button</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Save your\
    \ public key by clicking 'Save public key' button. You should give a\n name that\
    \ you can better identify the key in the future</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Save your\
    \ private key by clicking 'Save private key' button. It is the same\n as public\
    \ key to give a sensible name for future reference. Ignore the\n passphrase</p>\n\
    </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Linux/Mac User</h3>\n<p>Type ssh-keygen in console and enter.\
    \ This generates a public key (id_rsa.pub)\nand a private key(id_rsa). By default,\
    \ the two keys are located in ~/.ssh</p>\n<h3>Import Public Key</h3>\n<p>Public\
    \ key generated by Windows/Linux/Mac are required to be imported into\nNeCTAR\
    \ cloud dash board before use.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Log into the dashboard at <a\
    \ href=\"https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au\">Cloud Dashboard</a></p>\n</li>\n\
    <li>\n<p>Go to Access and Security Tab and then to the Keypairs page</p>\n</li>\n\
    <li>\n<p>Click 'Import Key Pair' button</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Type in a keypair\
    \ name and paste the contents of the public key. For Windows\n User, open PuTTYgen\
    \ and click 'Load' button to load the related private key and\n copy/paste the\
    \ public key contents. For Linux/Mac user, type cat id_rsa.pub and\n copy/paste\
    \ the public key contest from console output</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>NeCTAR Cloud\
    \ Dashboard</h3>\n<p>Key pairs can also be created directly through the NeCTAR\
    \ Cloud Dashboard.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>login to the dashboard at <a href=\"https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au\"\
    >Cloud Dashboard</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Go to Access and Security Tab and then\
    \ to the Keypairs page</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click 'Create Key Pair' button</p>\n\
    </li>\n<li>\n<p>Type in a keypair name in the pop out window and click 'Create\
    \ Key Pair'\n button</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Save the private key into a directory</p>\n\
    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Notes:\nIf you are running a Windows machine the SSH private\
    \ key may need to be\nconverted (use PuTTYgen for converting keys)</p>\n<ul>\n\
    <li>\n<p>Open PuTTYgen</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click 'Load' button to load private\
    \ key</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click 'Export OpenSSH key' from 'Conversions' menu</p>\n\
    </li>\n<li>\n<p>Type a private key name and save</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Select\
    \ an Image</h2>\n<p>You need to select an image to be used for your instance.\
    \ The image defines what\noperating system the instance uses and thus you need\
    \ to select an image based on\nyour needs. NecTAR Cloud offers a list of predefined\
    \ official images and for\nsimplicity, these images are recommended. You can find\
    \ a complete list of\nofficial images from <a href=\"https://wiki.rc.nectar.org.au/wiki/Image_Catalog\"\
    >NeCTAR image catalog</a>. You can also find all\navailable from <a href=\"https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au\"\
    >Cloud Dashboard</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>login to the dashboard at <a href=\"\
    https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au\">Cloud Dashboard</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Go\
    \ to Dashboard Images tab</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For advanced users, you can also\
    \ create your own images. Please refer to\n<a href=\"http://docs.openstack.org/image-guide/content/ch_creating_images_manually.html\"\
    >openstack documentation</a> for more details.</p>\n<h2>Configure Instance</h2>\n\
    <p>Before you can launch a instance, you need to configure the below options:</p>\n\
    <h3>Details</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Instance Name: your choice of name for the instance\
    \ to reference in future</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Flavour: the specification of the\
    \ instance. It gives your number of VCPUs,\n size of root disk, size of ephemeral\
    \ disk and size of RAM. Your allocated\n flavour or lesser configurations can\
    \ be selected (the default is m1.small a 1\n CPU machine)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Instance\
    \ Count: number of instance to launch (the default is 1)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Instance\
    \ Boot Source: the media used to boot the instance. you can boot from\n image,\
    \ snapshot and volume(the default is boot from image)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Boot\
    \ from image: Boot instance using an image</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Boot from snapshot:\
    \ Boot instance using an snapshot</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Boot from volume: Boot\
    \ instance from volume storage</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Image Name: the name of an\
    \ Image. This option depends on instance boot source</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Access\
    \ &amp; Security</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Key Pair: the public/private keys used to\
    \ log into the instance. See above to\n see how to create them</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\
    <p>Security Groups: add network access to your instances. This determines what\n\
    \ services can be accessed on the instance. You must select 'SSH' Security Groups\n\
    \ to allow you to login via SSH. If 'SSH' Security Groups is not available, you\n\
    \ can create it by going to Access $ Security tab on the right hand side of the\n\
    \ Cloud Dashboard. The default Security Group (no network access at first) is\n\
    \ pre-selected</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To create a Security Group:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n\
    <p>login to the dashboard at <a href=\"https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au\">Cloud\

        desc_un_html: " Getting An Account \n If you work or study at an Australian\
          \ University you will be able to login to\nthe Nectar Cloud using your institutional\
          \ credentials. Access to the Nectar\nCloud is enabled by the Australian\
          \ Access Federation (AAF). \n AAF Authentication \n Your AAF credentials\
          \ are the same as your institutional username and password.\nTo check that\
          \ your organisation is a member of the AAF check the\ncomplete AAF member\
          \ list here. \n If your institution is not a member of the AAF, talk to\
          \ your local IT team\nto arrange access. \n Logging in \n Once you have\
          \ obtained your AAF credentials, you can follow these steps to\nlogin to\
          \ NeCTAR Dashboard: \n \n \n Click 'log in' \n \n \n In dropdown list, select\
          \ the name of your research institution \n \n \n Click 'Select' \n \n \n\
          \ Wait until the selected institutional login page appears \n \n \n Type\
          \ in your username and password \n \n \n Click 'Continue' \n \n \n If you\
          \ have any issues contact the Nectar help team. \n API Credentials \n The\
          \ first time you login to the dashboard a NeCTAR Cloud account is created\n\
          for you. You will need this account if you want to access the Cloud outside\
          \ of\nthe dashboard through the API. The API is a programming interface\
          \ providing\nmore flexibility of utilising the power of the cloud. \n There\
          \ are two types of API credentials and which one you use will depend on\n\
          the API client you use. The below section only works for Linux/Unix users.\
          \ \n Openstack API \n It requires 6 variables to be set in order to authenticate\
          \ against\nthe NeCTAR Cloud: \n \n \n OS_AUTH_URL: authentication URL \n\
          \ \n \n OS_TENANT_ID: tenant id \n \n \n OS_TENANT_NAME: tenant name (optional)\
          \ \n \n \n OS_USERNAME: username \n \n \n OS_PASSWORD: password \n \n \n\
          \ OS_REGION_NAME:  location of your configuration (optional) \n \n \n You\
          \ can set these variables through\nenvironment variables. For example: \n\
          \ OS_AUTH_URL: URL \n OS_TENANT_NAME=my_science_project \n OS_USERNAME=clouduser@example.edu.au\
          \ \n OS_PASSWORD=XXXXXX \n If you are a member of multiple projects (tenants)\
          \ you may also want to set:\nOS_NO_CACHE=True \n The Dashboard provides\
          \ a convenient way to help you setting up these variables\nvia a shell script\
          \ file. You can follow the below steps to obtain it: \n \n \n Go To Dashboard\
          \ \n \n \n Login to dashboard via AAF Credentials \n \n \n Click 'Access\
          \ & Security' \n \n \n Click 'API Access' tap \n \n \n Click 'Download OpenStack\
          \ RC File' \n \n \n Save the shell script file in your local computer/laptop\
          \ \n \n \n The password is not automatically set for you for security reason.\
          \ You can also\nobtain the API password from NeCTAR cloud. Please follow\
          \ the below steps to get\nthe password: \n \n \n Go To Dashboard \n \n \n\
          \ Login to dashboard via AAF Credentials \n \n \n On the right top of the\
          \ page, click drop down list containing your email\n address \n \n \n Click\
          \ 'Settings' \n \n \n Click 'Reset Password' button \n \n \n The copy/paste\
          \ the password appeared on the screen to a text file, then save\n the text\
          \ file in your local computer/laptop. \n \n \n To execute the shell script\
          \ file, type source filename, then enter the password\nyou obtained earlier\
          \ from NeCTAR dashboard. \n Now, you are authenticated and please refer\
          \ to\nrelevant API document to see how to interact with the\nNeCTAR Cloud.\
          \ \n EC2 API \n There are 2 variables needed when using EC2 API clients:\
          \ \n \n \n EC2_ACCESS_KEY: username \n \n \n EC2_SECRET_KEY: password \n\
          \ \n \n You can obtain these 2 variables via the NeTCAR Dashboard: \n \n\
          \ \n Go To Dashboard \n \n \n Login to dashboard via AAF Credentials \n\
          \ \n \n Click 'Access & Security' \n \n \n Click 'API Access' tap \n \n\
          \ \n Click 'Download EC2 Credentials' \n \n \n Save the zip file in your\
          \ local computer/laptop \n \n \n Unzip the saved zip file and open ec2rc.sh\
          \ file via a text editor \n \n \n You can find EC2_ACCESS_KEY and EC2_SECRET_KEY\
          \ in the file \n \n \n Login Problems \n If your login details are rejected\
          \ first\ncheck your Research Institution is a member of the AAF. \n If your\
          \ research institution is a member but you still can't login, you can\n\
          contact IT Service department of your own research institution.\nThey can\
          \ provide support for issues with your login credentials. Alternatively,\n\
          you can email to support@rc.nectar.org.au. "

          Collaboration Tools and Resources) is\nan Australian Government project\
          \ funded to build new\ninfrastructure specifically for the\nneeds of Australian\
          \ researchers. All Australian researchers\nhave access to the Nectar Cloud\
          \ via the\nAAF. \n To access the cloud all users must first login through\
          \ the\nNectar Cloud dashboard:\nhttps://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au/ \n Instances\
          \ \n Instances running inside the Research Cloud are just like\nreal-life\
          \ machines but in a\nremote location. The Research Cloud is used to start,\
          \ copy\nand delete instances.\nThey have an operating system (you select\
          \ it from a list),\nnetwork access (a real IP\naddress & you specify any\
          \ access), and hard disk storage. With\nno hardware to\nmaintain you can\
          \ copy (Snapshot) and customise new machines\nrapidly. \n Tools \n The Nectar\
          \ Cloud Dashboard \n The Dashboard provides a web interface to get all the\
          \ basic\nResearch Cloud related jobs done. \n Use the dashboard: \n \n for\
          \ basic Cloud operations: (launching, duplicating & terminating ) instances\
          \ \n to get [Credentials] you can use with other [API clients] \n to make\
          \ an allocation request for a larger ongoing share of Research Cloud Resources.\
          \ \n \n More about instances \n If you are familiar with connecting to remote\
          \ machines already\nthe same tools and techniques apply when connecting\
          \ to running\ninstances. Your instance has a public IP address and, if\n\
          configured, can be reached and controlled with any remote\naccess tools\
          \ you wish to use. Example SSH. \n More information about launching and\
          \ managing instances is here \n Images \n Instances originate from Images\
          \ and can be a plain \"off the\nshelf\" Operating System or include software\
          \ packages and\nconfig changes to suit a particular purpose (eg Webserving).\n\
          There are publicly available images in the cloud ready for\nyou to use.\
          \ \n To suit your specific purposes an instance may need some\ncustomisation,\
          \ configuration changes or software installation.\nIts a good idea to make\
          \ a copy of the instance if you wish to\nre-use its current state as a starting\
          \ point for new instances.\nIf you are experimenting and making changes,\
          \ a copy allows you\nto return to the copied state and dispose of the experiment\n\
          without having to undo/redo configuration changes. \n You can create an\
          \ Image from scratch, but usually its easier\nto customise & copy a running\
          \ instance that is close\nto what you need. \n Copies of instances are called\
          \ Snapshots and can be used\nlike other Images to start new instances. Making\
          \ a Snapshot\nis simple: \n \n Go to the Dashboard \u2018Instances\u2019\
          \ tab \n Click \"Create Snapshot\" for the running instance you wish to\
          \ copy. \n \n Keypairs \n Key Pairs enable you to communicate with your\
          \ instance via\nSSH. When launching an instance you specify an existing\
          \ key\npair. The public key is injected into the running\ninstance's authorized_keys\
          \ file. \n You can manage your keypairs through the Dashboard or via\nthe\
          \ nova CLI client. \n In the dashboard under the Access & Security tab you\
          \ can\nmanage your keys. You have the option of: \n \n Importing an existing\
          \ SSH key you own \n Creating a new SSH Key \n \n Important: Keypairs can\
          \ only be specified on instance\ncreation, if you don't specify a keypair\
          \ on creation you will\nnot be able to add it later. \n Security groups\
          \ \n Incoming network access to your machines is usually required.\nSecurity\
          \ Groups are how to add network access. If you can't\nreach your instance\
          \ by SSH to login or by browser if it\nruns a Webserver additional Security\
          \ Group settings could be\nneeded. \n [Add link to more info] \n Storage\
          \ in the cloud \n The NeCTAR Research Cloud provides instances for research\n\
          use. While resources like processing cores, RAM and the\namount of storage\
          \ you get are dedicated to a particular\ninstance, other resources like\
          \ the network and the underlying\nstorage system are shared among instances.\
          \ Furthermore, not\nall storage is created equal, and Research Cloud users\n\
          have a few different types of storage available which differ\naccording\
          \ to performance, persistence and data safety. \n To find out which storage\
          \ option is right for you. We need\nto write the documentation for it. [LINK] "

          \ from Images and can be a plain \"off the\nshelf\" Operating System or\
          \ include software packages and\nconfig changes to suit a particular purpose\
          \ (eg Webserving).\nThere are publicly available images in the cloud ready\
          \ for\nyou to use.</p>\n<p>To suit your specific purposes an instance may\
          \ need some\ncustomisation, configuration changes or software installation.\n\
          Its a good idea to make a copy of the instance if you wish to\nre-use its\
          \ current state as a starting point for new instances.\nIf you are experimenting\
          \ and making changes, a copy allows you\nto return to the copied state and\
          \ dispose of the experiment\nwithout having to undo/redo configuration changes.</p>\n\
          <p>You can create an Image from scratch, but usually its easier\nto customise\
          \ &amp; copy a running instance that is close\nto what you need.</p>\n<p>Copies\
          \ of instances are called Snapshots and can be used\nlike other Images to\
          \ start new instances. Making a Snapshot\nis simple:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to\
          \ the Dashboard \u2018Instances\u2019 tab</li>\n<li>Click \"Create Snapshot\"\
          \ for the running instance you wish to copy.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Keypairs</h2>\n\
          <p>Key Pairs enable you to communicate with your instance via\nSSH. When\
          \ launching an instance you specify an existing key\npair. The public key\
          \ is injected into the running\ninstance's authorized_keys file.</p>\n<p>You\
          \ can manage your keypairs through the Dashboard or via\nthe nova CLI client.</p>\n\
          <p>In the dashboard under the Access &amp; Security tab you can\nmanage\
          \ your keys. You have the option of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Importing an existing\
          \ SSH key you own</li>\n<li>Creating a new SSH Key</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Important:</strong>\
          \ Keypairs can only be specified on instance\ncreation, if you don't specify\
          \ a keypair on creation you will\nnot be able to add it later.</p>\n<h2>Security\
          \ groups</h2>\n<p>Incoming network access to your machines is usually required.\n\
          Security Groups are how to add network access. If you can't\nreach your\
          \ instance by SSH to login or by browser if it\nruns a Webserver additional\
          \ Security Group settings could be\nneeded.</p>\n<p>[Add link to more info]</p>\n\
          <h2>Storage in the cloud</h2>\n<p>The NeCTAR Research Cloud provides instances\
          \ for research\nuse. While resources like processing cores, RAM and the\n\
          amount of storage you get are dedicated to a particular\ninstance, other\
          \ resources like the network and the underlying\nstorage system are shared\
          \ among instances. Furthermore, not\nall storage is created equal, and Research\
          \ Cloud users\nhave a few different types of storage available which differ\n\

    <h2>What is the Nectar Cloud</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://nectar.org.au/\">Nectar</a>\
    \ (National eResearch\nCollaboration Tools and Resources) is\nan Australian Government\
    \ project funded to build new\ninfrastructure specifically for the\nneeds of Australian\
    \ researchers. All Australian researchers\nhave access to the Nectar Cloud via\
    \ the\n<a href=\"http://support.rc.nectar.org.au/node/111\">AAF</a>.</p>\n<p>To\
    \ access the cloud all users must first login through the\nNectar Cloud dashboard:\n\
    <a href=\"https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au/\">https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au/</a></p>\n\
    <h2>Instances</h2>\n<p>Instances running inside the Research Cloud are just like\n\
    real-life machines but in a\nremote location. The Research Cloud is used to start,\
    \ copy\nand delete instances.\nThey have an operating system (you select it from\
    \ a list),\nnetwork access (a real IP\naddress &amp; you specify any access),\
    \ and hard disk storage. With\nno hardware to\nmaintain you can copy (Snapshot)\
    \ and customise new machines\nrapidly.</p>\n<h2>Tools</h2>\n<h3>The Nectar Cloud\
    \ Dashboard</h3>\n<p>The Dashboard provides a web interface to get all the basic\n\
    Research Cloud related jobs done.</p>\n<p>Use the dashboard:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>for\
    \ basic Cloud operations: (launching, duplicating &amp; terminating ) instances</li>\n\
    <li>to get [Credentials] you can use with other [API clients]</li>\n<li>to make\
    \ an allocation request for a larger ongoing share of Research Cloud Resources.</li>\n\
    </ul>\n<h3>More about instances</h3>\n<p>If you are familiar with connecting to\
    \ remote machines already\nthe same tools and techniques apply when connecting\
    \ to running\ninstances. Your instance has a public IP address and, if\nconfigured,\
    \ can be reached and controlled with any remote\naccess tools you wish to use.\
