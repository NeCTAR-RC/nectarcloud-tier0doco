        desc_un_html: " Launching Virtual Machines \n This guide describes launching\
          \ a running instance (virtual machine) with SSH login\nenabled. \n Preparation\
          \ \n You need to create a public/private key pair before you can use SSH\
          \ to login to \nthe newly created instance. The public key will be inserted\
          \ into the instance and\nthe private key is used on your desktop/laptop.\
          \ \n Windows User \n Use PuTTYgen key generator to generate the required\
          \ key pair. \n \n \n Download PuTTYgen (puttygen.exe) from PuTTYgen download\
          \ page \n \n \n Launch the PuTTYgen application by double clicking the puttygen.exe\
          \ \n \n \n The default settings are fine for this case, click the 'Generate'\
          \ button \n \n \n Save your public key by clicking 'Save public key' button.\
          \ You should give a\n name that will help identify the key in the future\
          \ \n \n \n Save your private key by clicking 'Save private key' button.\
          \ You should give\n a sensible name for future reference. The passphrase\
          \ can provide additional\n security, though can be left empty \n \n \n Linux/Mac\
          \ User \n Type ssh-keygen in the terminal and enter. This generates a public\
          \ key (id_rsa.pub)\nand a private key (id_rsa). By default, the two keys\
          \ are located in ~/.ssh \n Import Public Key \n The public key generated\
          \ by Windows/Linux/Mac are required to be imported into\nthe Nectar Cloud\
          \ dashboard before use. \n \n \n Log into the Cloud Dashboard \n \n \n Go\
          \ to the Access and Security tab and then to the Keypairs page \n \n \n\
          \ Click 'Import Key Pair' button \n \n \n Type in a keypair name and paste\
          \ the contents of the public key. For Windows\n users, open PuTTYgen and\
          \ click 'Load' button to load the related private key and\n copy/paste the\
          \ public key contents. For Linux/Mac user, type\n cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\
          \ and copy/paste the public key contents from the terminal\n output \n \n\
          \ \n Nectar Cloud Dashboard \n Key pairs can also be created directly through\
          \ the Nectar Cloud Dashboard. \n \n \n Login to the Cloud Dashboard \n \n\
          \ \n Go to the Access and Security tab and then to the Keypairs page \n\
          \ \n \n Click the 'Create Key Pair' button \n \n \n Type in a keypair name\
          \ in the popup window and click the 'Create Key Pair'\n button \n \n \n\
          \ Save the private key into a directory \n \n \n Notes: If you are running\
          \ a Windows machine the SSH private key will need to be\nconverted (use\
          \ PuTTYgen for converting keys) \n \n \n Open PuTTYgen \n \n \n Click 'Load'\
          \ button to load the private key generated by the Cloud Dashboard \n \n\
          \ \n Click 'Export OpenSSH key' from 'Conversions' menu \n \n \n Type a\
          \ private key name and save \n \n \n Select an Image \n You need to select\
          \ an image to be used for your instance. The image defines what\noperating\
          \ system the instance uses and thus you need to select an image based on\n\
          your needs. Nectar Cloud offers a list of official images and for\nsimplicity,\
          \ these images are recommended. You can find a complete list of\nofficial\
          \ images from Nectar image catalog. You can also find all\navailable images\
          \ from the Cloud Dashboard. \n \n \n Login to the Cloud Dashboard \n \n\
          \ \n Go to the Dashboard Images tab \n \n \n For advanced users, you can\
          \ also create your own images. Please refer to\nthe openstack documentation\
          \ for more details. \n Configure Instance \n Before you can launch an instance,\
          \ you need to configure the below options: \n Details \n \n \n Instance\
          \ Name: the name used by the dashboard to identify the instance \n \n \n\
          \ Flavour: the resources available for the instance. It specifies the number\
          \ of\n VCPUs, size of root disk, size of ephemeral disk and size of RAM.\n\
          \ Your allocated flavour or lesser configurations can be selected (the\n\
          \ default is m2.tiny; a 1 VCPU machine) \n \n \n Instance Count: number\
          \ of instance to launch (the default is 1) \n \n \n Instance Boot Source:\
          \ the media used to boot the instance. You can boot from\n image, snapshot\
          \ and volume (the default is boot from image) \n \n \n Boot from image:\
          \ Boot instance using an image \n \n \n Boot from snapshot: Boot instance\
          \ using a snapshot \n \n \n Boot from volume: Boot instance from volume\
          \ storage \n \n \n Image Name: the name of an Image. This option is used\
          \ when the Instance Boot\n Source is 'Boot from image' \n \n \n Access &\
          \ Security \n \n \n Key Pair: the public/private keys used to log into the\
          \ instance. See above to\n see how to create them. This can't be added or\
          \ changed after the instance is\n created. \n \n \n Security Groups: add\
          \ network access to your instances. This determines what\n services can\
          \ be accessed on the instance. You must select 'SSH' Security Groups\n to\
          \ allow you to login via SSH. If 'SSH' Security Groups is not available,\
          \ you\n can create it by going to Access & Security tab on the right hand\
          \ side of the\n Cloud Dashboard. The default Security Group (no network\
          \ access at first) is\n pre-selected \n \n \n To create a Security Group:\
          \ \n \n \n Login to the Cloud Dashboard \n \n \n Go to the Access & Security\
          \ tab \n \n \n Click 'Create Security Group' button \n \n \n Give a name\
          \ for the Security Group \n \n \n Give a meaningful description for the\
          \ Security Group \n \n \n Click 'Create Security Group' button \n \n \n\
          \ The newly created Security Group has no rules added (no network access\
          \ defined).\nTo add rules to a Security Group: \n \n \n Go to the Access\
          \ & Security tab \n \n \n Tick to select the Security Group to add rules\
          \ \n \n \n Click 'Manage Rules' button \n \n \n Click 'Add Rule' button\
          \ \n \n \n Select what type of Rule you want to create \n \n \n Select from\
          \ 'Open Port' the 'Port' option to open one single port, or 'Port Range'\n\
          \ to open a range of ports \n \n \n The 'Remote' option specifies the source\
          \ of the traffic to be allowed via this\n rule. You may do so either in\
          \ the form of an IP address block (CIDR) or via a\n source group (Security\
          \ Group). \n \n \n Click 'Add' button \n \n \n You can also click 'Delete\
          \ Rule' button to delete a rule \n Availability Zone \n Select the Availability\
          \ Zone for your instance. The Availability Zone is the\nlocation for your\
          \ instance. By default, the system will select an available\nlocation for\
          \ you. You can also click the 'Advanced' button to select from a\ncomplete\
          \ list of available Availability Zones \n Post-Creation \n You can execute\
          \ a customization script after you launch your instance. You can\ndo any\
          \ initialization and customization to your instance by using this and it\n\
          is executed only once at the first boot of your instance. You can copy/paste\n\
          your script by selecting 'Direct Input' or you can upload a script file.\
          \ The\nscript can be a shell script or Cloud-init script. \n Advanced Options\
          \ \n You can choose whether you automaticly or manually create the disk\
          \ partition.\nIn most cases, you shouldn't change the default. \n Notes:\
          \ The above configuration options can be set in the 'Launch Instance' popup\n\
          window. To launch the popup window, you can go to the Instances tab and\n\
          click 'Launch Instance' button. \n To get more information about the terms\
          \ used, please refer to\nthe glossary. \n Example Launch of an Instance\
          \ \n \n \n Login to the Cloud Dashboard \n \n \n Go to Dashboard Instances\
          \ tab \n \n \n Click 'Launch Instance' button \n \n \n Type instance name\
          \ \n \n \n Select a flavour. Flavour indicates the specification of a instance.\
          \ You can\n find more information in the Flavour Details. \n \n \n Select\
          \ an NeCTAR offical image (we suggest selecting an Ubuntu image such as\n\
          \ NeCTAR Ubuntu 14.10 (Utopic) amd64) \n \n \n Click Access & Security tab\
          \ \n \n \n Select a key pair created earlier \n \n \n Select security groups\
          \ to use. Tick 'ssh' and 'http' (these are pre-defined\n groups in the default\
          \ personal project) \n \n \n Click Availability Zone \n \n \n Select the\
          \ location of your instance or leave as unselected (the system will\n auto\
          \ select available location) \n \n \n Click launch button and the page will\
          \ change to the Instances Tab \n \n \n After a while (usually a couple of\
          \ minutes), your instance will become active\n and will have an IP address.\
          \ The IP address is available in the Instances table \n \n \n The launch\
          \ button begins Cloud provisioning and initialisation of a running\ninstance\
          \ from the selected image and your configuration options. The instance\n\
          will normally pass from status \"Build\" to \"Active\". Depending on your\
          \ image\nsize and cloud activity, the length of time required may vary.\
          \ Your instance\nwill have a public IP address and be reachable according\
          \ to the\nSecurity Groups selected. \n You can connect to your new instance\
          \ via\nAccessing Your Instance \n If Launch is Unsuccessful \n You may get\
          \ a message that your quota has been exceeded or you have\ninsufficient\
          \ resources. Check the table to the right on the Launch Instance page\n\
          for the number of instances you may run simultaneously, then check the\n\
          Instances tab to see how many Instances you already have running. You may\
          \ have\nto terminate a running Instance to free resources before you can\
          \ launch another\n(see Instance tab to Terminate). If you need more resources\
          \ see the allocation\ntab to apply for an increase. \n If the above doesn't\
          \ apply to you, alternatively, you can send an email to the\nCloud Help\
          \ Desk. Please find how to lodge a support ticket from\nNectar Support. "

  html: "<h1>Launching Virtual Machines</h1>\n<p>This guide describes launching a\
    \ running instance (virtual machine) with SSH login\nenabled.</p>\n<h2>Preparation</h2>\n\
    <p>You need to create a public/private key pair before you can use SSH to login\
    \ to \nthe newly created instance. The public key will be inserted into the instance\
    \ and\nthe private key is used on your desktop/laptop.</p>\n<h3>Windows User</h3>\n\
    <p>Use PuTTYgen key generator to generate the required key pair.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n\
    <p>Download PuTTYgen (puttygen.exe) from <a href=\"http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html\"\
    >PuTTYgen download page</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Launch the PuTTYgen application\
    \ by double clicking the puttygen.exe</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The default settings\
    \ are fine for this case, click the 'Generate' button</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Save\
    \ your public key by clicking 'Save public key' button. You should give a\n name\
    \ that will help identify the key in the future</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Save your\
    \ private key by clicking 'Save private key' button. You should give\n a sensible\
    \ name for future reference. The passphrase can provide additional\n security,\
    \ though can be left empty</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Linux/Mac User</h3>\n<p>Type\
    \ ssh-keygen in the terminal and enter. This generates a public key (id_rsa.pub)\n\
    and a private key (id_rsa). By default, the two keys are located in ~/.ssh</p>\n\
    <h3>Import Public Key</h3>\n<p>The public key generated by Windows/Linux/Mac are\
    \ required to be imported into\nthe Nectar Cloud dashboard before use.</p>\n<ul>\n\
    <li>\n<p>Log into the <a href=\"https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au\">Cloud Dashboard</a></p>\n\
    </li>\n<li>\n<p>Go to the Access and Security tab and then to the Keypairs page</p>\n\
    </li>\n<li>\n<p>Click 'Import Key Pair' button</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Type in a\
    \ keypair name and paste the contents of the public key. For Windows\n users,\
    \ open PuTTYgen and click 'Load' button to load the related private key and\n\
    \ copy/paste the public key contents. For Linux/Mac user, type\n cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\
    \ and copy/paste the public key contents from the terminal\n output</p>\n</li>\n\
    </ul>\n<h3>Nectar Cloud Dashboard</h3>\n<p>Key pairs can also be created directly\
    \ through the Nectar Cloud Dashboard.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Login to the <a href=\"\
    https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au\">Cloud Dashboard</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Go\
    \ to the Access and Security tab and then to the Keypairs page</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\
    <p>Click the 'Create Key Pair' button</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Type in a keypair name\
    \ in the popup window and click the 'Create Key Pair'\n button</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\
    <p>Save the private key into a directory</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Notes: If you are\
    \ running a Windows machine the SSH private key will need to be\nconverted (use\
    \ PuTTYgen for converting keys)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Open PuTTYgen</p>\n</li>\n\
    <li>\n<p>Click 'Load' button to load the private key generated by the Cloud Dashboard</p>\n\
    </li>\n<li>\n<p>Click 'Export OpenSSH key' from 'Conversions' menu</p>\n</li>\n\
    <li>\n<p>Type a private key name and save</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Select an Image</h2>\n\
    <p>You need to select an image to be used for your instance. The image defines\
    \ what\noperating system the instance uses and thus you need to select an image\
    \ based on\nyour needs. Nectar Cloud offers a list of official images and for\n\
    simplicity, these images are recommended. You can find a complete list of\nofficial\
    \ images from <a href=\"https://wiki.rc.nectar.org.au/wiki/Image_Catalog\">Nectar\
    \ image catalog</a>. You can also find all\navailable images from the <a href=\"\
    https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au\">Cloud Dashboard</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Login\
    \ to the <a href=\"https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au\">Cloud Dashboard</a></p>\n\
    </li>\n<li>\n<p>Go to the Dashboard Images tab</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For advanced\
    \ users, you can also create your own images. Please refer to\nthe <a href=\"\
    http://docs.openstack.org/image-guide/content/ch_creating_images_manually.html\"\
    >openstack documentation</a> for more details.</p>\n<h2>Configure Instance</h2>\n\
    <p>Before you can launch an instance, you need to configure the below options:</p>\n\
    <h3>Details</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Instance Name: the name used by the dashboard\
    \ to identify the instance</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Flavour: the resources available\
    \ for the instance. It specifies the number of\n VCPUs, size of root disk, size\
    \ of ephemeral disk and size of RAM.\n Your allocated flavour or lesser configurations\
    \ can be selected (the\n default is m2.tiny; a 1 VCPU machine)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\
    <p>Instance Count: number of instance to launch (the default is 1)</p>\n</li>\n\
    <li>\n<p>Instance Boot Source: the media used to boot the instance. You can boot\
    \ from\n image, snapshot and volume (the default is boot from image)</p>\n</li>\n\
    <li>\n<p>Boot from image: Boot instance using an image</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Boot\
    \ from snapshot: Boot instance using a snapshot</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Boot from\
    \ volume: Boot instance from volume storage</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Image Name: the\
    \ name of an Image. This option is used when the Instance Boot\n Source is 'Boot\
    \ from image'</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Access &amp; Security</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n\
    <p>Key Pair: the public/private keys used to log into the instance. See above\
    \ to\n see how to create them. This can't be added or changed after the instance\
    \ is\n created.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Security Groups: add network access to your\
    \ instances. This determines what\n services can be accessed on the instance.\
    \ You must select 'SSH' Security Groups\n to allow you to login via SSH. If 'SSH'\
    \ Security Groups is not available, you\n can create it by going to Access &amp;\
    \ Security tab on the right hand side of the\n Cloud Dashboard. The default Security\
    \ Group (no network access at first) is\n pre-selected</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To\
    \ create a Security Group:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Login to the <a href=\"https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au\"\
    >Cloud Dashboard</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Go to the Access &amp; Security tab</p>\n\
    </li>\n<li>\n<p>Click 'Create Security Group' button</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Give\
    \ a name for the Security Group</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Give a meaningful description\
    \ for the Security Group</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click 'Create Security Group' button</p>\n\
    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>The newly created Security Group has no rules added (no network\
    \ access defined).\nTo add rules to a Security Group:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Go to\
    \ the Access &amp; Security tab</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tick to select the Security\
    \ Group to add rules</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click 'Manage Rules' button</p>\n</li>\n\
    <li>\n<p>Click 'Add Rule' button</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Select what type of Rule\
    \ you want to create</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Select from 'Open Port' the 'Port' option\
    \ to open one single port, or 'Port Range'\n to open a range of ports</p>\n</li>\n\
    <li>\n<p>The 'Remote' option specifies the source of the traffic to be allowed\
    \ via this\n rule. You may do so either in the form of an IP address block (CIDR)\
    \ or via a\n source group (Security Group).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click 'Add' button</p>\n\
    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can also click 'Delete Rule' button to delete a rule</p>\n\
    <h3>Availability Zone</h3>\n<p>Select the Availability Zone for your instance.\

    \ will select an available\nlocation for you. You can also click the 'Advanced'\
    \ button to select from a\ncomplete list of available Availability Zones</p>\n\
    <h3>Post-Creation</h3>\n<p>You can execute a customization script after you launch\
    \ your instance. You can\ndo any initialization and customization to your instance\
    \ by using this and it\nis executed only once at the first boot of your instance.\
    \ You can copy/paste\nyour script by selecting 'Direct Input' or you can upload\
    \ a script file. The\nscript can be a shell script or Cloud-init script.</p>\n\
    <h3>Advanced Options</h3>\n<p>You can choose whether you automaticly or manually\
    \ create the disk partition.\nIn most cases, you shouldn't change the default.</p>\n\
    <p>Notes: The above configuration options can be set in the 'Launch Instance'\
    \ popup\nwindow. To launch the popup window, you can go to the Instances tab and\n\
    click 'Launch Instance' button.</p>\n<p>To get more information about the terms\

          \ is a member of the AAF check the\ncomplete AAF member list here. \n If\
          \ your institution is not a member of the AAF, talk to your local IT team\n\
          to arrange access. \n Logging in \n Once you have obtained your AAF credentials,\
          \ you can follow these steps to\nlogin to NeCTAR Dashboard: \n \n \n Click\
          \ 'log in' \n \n \n In dropdown list, select the name of your research institution\
          \ \n \n \n Click 'Select' \n \n \n Wait until the selected institutional\
          \ login page appears \n \n \n Type in your username and password \n \n \n\
          \ Click 'Continue' \n \n \n If you have any issues contact the Nectar help\
          \ team. \n API Credentials \n The first time you login to the dashboard\
          \ a NeCTAR Cloud account is created\nfor you. You will need this account\
          \ if you want to access the Cloud outside of\nthe dashboard through the\
          \ API. The API is a programming interface providing\nmore flexibility of\
          \ utilising the power of the cloud. \n There are two types of API credentials\
          \ and which one you use will depend on\nthe API client you use. The below\
          \ section only works for Linux/Unix users. \n Openstack API \n It requires\
          \ 6 variables to be set in order to authenticate against\nthe NeCTAR Cloud:\
          \ \n \n \n OS_AUTH_URL: authentication URL \n \n \n OS_TENANT_ID: tenant\
          \ id \n \n \n OS_TENANT_NAME: tenant name (optional) \n \n \n OS_USERNAME:\
          \ username \n \n \n OS_PASSWORD: password \n \n \n OS_REGION_NAME:  location\
          \ of your configuration (optional) \n \n \n You can set these variables\
          \ through\nenvironment variables. For example: \n OS_AUTH_URL: URL \n OS_TENANT_NAME=my_science_project\
          \ \n OS_USERNAME=clouduser@example.edu.au \n OS_PASSWORD=XXXXXX \n If you\
          \ are a member of multiple projects (tenants) you may also want to set:\n\
          OS_NO_CACHE=True \n The Dashboard provides a convenient way to help you\
          \ setting up these variables\nvia a shell script file. You can follow the\
          \ below steps to obtain it: \n \n \n Go To Dashboard \n \n \n Login to dashboard\
          \ via AAF Credentials \n \n \n Click 'Access & Security' \n \n \n Click\
          \ 'API Access' tap \n \n \n Click 'Download OpenStack RC File' \n \n \n\
          \ Save the shell script file in your local computer/laptop \n \n \n The\
          \ password is not automatically set for you for security reason. You can\
          \ also\nobtain the API password from NeCTAR cloud. Please follow the below\
          \ steps to get\nthe password: \n \n \n Go To Dashboard \n \n \n Login to\
          \ dashboard via AAF Credentials \n \n \n On the right top of the page, click\
          \ drop down list containing your email\n address \n \n \n Click 'Settings'\
          \ \n \n \n Click 'Reset Password' button \n \n \n The copy/paste the password\
          \ appeared on the screen to a text file, then save\n the text file in your\
          \ local computer/laptop. \n \n \n To execute the shell script file, type\
          \ source filename, then enter the password\nyou obtained earlier from NeCTAR\
          \ dashboard. \n Now, you are authenticated and please refer to\nrelevant\
          \ API document to see how to interact with the\nNeCTAR Cloud. \n EC2 API\
          \ \n There are 2 variables needed when using EC2 API clients: \n \n \n EC2_ACCESS_KEY:\
          \ username \n \n \n EC2_SECRET_KEY: password \n \n \n You can obtain these\
          \ 2 variables via the NeTCAR Dashboard: \n \n \n Go To Dashboard \n \n \n\

          \ copy and delete\ninstances. They have an operating system (you select\

          \ Cloud Dashboard \n The Dashboard provides a web interface to get all the\
          \ basic\nResearch Cloud related jobs done. \n Use the dashboard: \n \n for\
          \ basic Cloud operations: (launching, duplicating & terminating ) instances\
          \ \n to get [Credentials] you can use with other [API clients] \n to make\
          \ an allocation request for a larger ongoing share of Research Cloud Resources.\
          \ \n \n More about instances \n If you are familiar with connecting to remote\
          \ machines already\nthe same tools and techniques apply when connecting\
          \ to running\ninstances. Your instance has a public IP address and, if\n\
          configured, can be reached and controlled with any remote\naccess tools\
          \ you wish to use. Example SSH. \n More information about launching and\
          \ managing instances is here \n Images \n Instances originate from Images\
          \ and can be a plain \"off the\nshelf\" Operating System or include software\
          \ packages and\nconfig changes to suit a particular purpose (eg Webserving).\n\
          There are publicly available images in the cloud ready for\nyou to use.\
          \ \n To suit your specific purposes an instance may need some\ncustomisation,\
          \ configuration changes or software installation.\nIts a good idea to make\
          \ a copy of the instance if you wish to\nre-use its current state as a starting\
          \ point for new instances.\nIf you are experimenting and making changes,\
          \ a copy allows you\nto return to the copied state and dispose of the experiment\n\
          without having to undo/redo configuration changes. \n You can create an\
          \ Image from scratch, but usually its easier\nto customise & copy a running\
          \ instance that is close\nto what you need. \n Copies of instances are called\
          \ Snapshots and can be used\nlike other Images to start new instances. Making\
          \ a Snapshot\nis simple: \n \n Go to the Dashboard \"Instances\" tab \n\
          \ Click \"Create Snapshot\" for the running instance you wish to copy. \n\
          \ \n Keypairs \n Key Pairs enable you to communicate with your instance\
          \ via\nSSH. When launching an instance you specify an existing key\npair.\
          \ The public key is injected into the running\ninstance's authorized_keys\
          \ file. \n You can manage your keypairs through the Dashboard or via\nthe\
          \ nova CLI client. \n In the dashboard under the Access & Security tab you\
          \ can\nmanage your keys. You have the option of: \n \n Importing an existing\
          \ SSH key you own \n Creating a new SSH Key \n \n Important: Keypairs can\
          \ only be specified on instance\ncreation, if you don't specify a keypair\
          \ on creation you will\nnot be able to add it later. \n Security groups\
          \ \n Incoming network access to your machines is usually required.\nSecurity\
          \ Groups are how to add network access. If you can't\nreach your instance\
          \ by SSH to login or by browser if it\nruns a Webserver additional Security\
          \ Group settings could be\nneeded. \n [Add link to more info] \n Storage\
          \ in the cloud \n The NeCTAR Research Cloud provides instances for research\n\
          use. While resources like processing cores, RAM and the\namount of storage\
          \ you get are dedicated to a particular\ninstance, other resources like\
          \ the network and the underlying\nstorage system are shared among instances.\
          \ Furthermore, not\nall storage is created equal, and Research Cloud users\n\
          have a few different types of storage available which differ\naccording\
          \ to performance, persistence and data safety. \n To find out which storage\
          \ option is right for you. We need\nto write the documentation for it. [LINK] "

          <h3>More about instances</h3>

          <p>If you are familiar with connecting to remote machines already

          the same tools and techniques apply when connecting to running

          instances. Your instance has a public IP address and, if

          configured, can be reached and controlled with any remote

          access tools you wish to use. Example SSH.</p>

          <p>More information about launching and managing instances is here</p>

          <h3>Images</h3>

          <p>Instances originate from Images and can be a plain "off the

          shelf" Operating System or include software packages and

          config changes to suit a particular purpose (eg Webserving).

          There are publicly available images in the cloud ready for

          you to use.</p>

          <p>To suit your specific purposes an instance may need some

          customisation, configuration changes or software installation.

          Its a good idea to make a copy of the instance if you wish to

          re-use its current state as a starting point for new instances.

          If you are experimenting and making changes, a copy allows you

          to return to the copied state and dispose of the experiment

          without having to undo/redo configuration changes.</p>

          <p>You can create an Image from scratch, but usually its easier

          to customise &amp; copy a running instance that is close

          to what you need.</p>

          <p>Copies of instances are called Snapshots and can be used

          like other Images to start new instances. Making a Snapshot

          is simple:</p>

          <ol>

          <li>Go to the Dashboard "Instances" tab</li>

          <li>Click "Create Snapshot" for the running instance you wish to copy.</li>

          </ol>

          <h2>Keypairs</h2>

          <p>Key Pairs enable you to communicate with your instance via

          SSH. When launching an instance you specify an existing key

          pair. The public key is injected into the running

          instance''s authorized_keys file.</p>

          <p>You can manage your keypairs through the Dashboard or via

          the nova CLI client.</p>

          <p>In the dashboard under the Access &amp; Security tab you can

          manage your keys. You have the option of:</p>

          <ul>

          <li>Importing an existing SSH key you own</li>

          <li>Creating a new SSH Key</li>

          </ul>

          <p><strong>Important:</strong> Keypairs can only be specified on instance

          creation, if you don''t specify a keypair on creation you will

          not be able to add it later.</p>

          <h2>Security groups</h2>

          <p>Incoming network access to your machines is usually required.

          Security Groups are how to add network access. If you can''t

          reach your instance by SSH to login or by browser if it

          runs a Webserver additional Security Group settings could be

          needed.</p>

          <p>[Add link to more info]</p>

          <h2>Storage in the cloud</h2>

          <p>The NeCTAR Research Cloud provides instances for research

          use. While resources like processing cores, RAM and the

          amount of storage you get are dedicated to a particular

          instance, other resources like the network and the underlying

          storage system are shared among instances. Furthermore, not

          all storage is created equal, and Research Cloud users

          have a few different types of storage available which differ

          according to performance, persistence and data safety.</p>

          <p>To find out which storage option is right for you. We need

          to write the documentation for it. [LINK]</p>'

    <h2>What is the Nectar Cloud</h2>

    <p><a href="http://nectar.org.au/">Nectar</a> (National eResearch Collaboration
    Tools and Resources) is an Australian Government project funded to build new infrastructure
    specifically for the needs of Australian researchers.  The Nectar Cloud provides
    supported computing infrastructure, giving researchers access to computing resources
    without the need to purchase or host their own hardware.<br>

    All Australian researchers have access to the Nectar Cloud via the <a href="http://support.rc.nectar.org.au/node/111">AAF</a>.</p>

    <p>To access the cloud all users must first login through the

    Nectar Cloud dashboard:

    <a href="https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au/">https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au/</a></p>

    <h2>Instances</h2>

    <p>Instances running inside the Research Cloud are just like real-life machines
    but

    in a remote location. The Research Cloud is used to start, copy and delete

    instances. They have an operating system (you select it from a list), network

    access (a real IP address &amp; you specify any access), and hard disk storage.

    With no hardware to maintain you can copy (Snapshot) and customise new

    machines rapidly.</p>

    <h2>Tools</h2>

    <h3>The Nectar Cloud Dashboard</h3>

    <p>The Dashboard provides a web interface to get all the basic

    Research Cloud related jobs done.</p>

    <p>Use the dashboard:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>for basic Cloud operations: (launching, duplicating &amp; terminating ) instances</li>

    <li>to get [Credentials] you can use with other [API clients]</li>

    <li>to make an allocation request for a larger ongoing share of Research Cloud
    Resources.</li>

    </ul>

    <p>When you are finished with an Instance, you should Terminate it.  Leaving an

    instance running, or in "paused" or "suspended" or "shutdown" states is tying

    down resources that other people could be using.</p>

    <p>Note that terminating an instance destroys its primary and ephemeral file

    systems.  If you want to save the primary file system (so that you can launch
    a

    new instance), snapshot the instance before you terminate it.</p>'

          \ them in order for it\nto function properly. Among these resources, storage\
          \ is the fundamental component\nfor both the virtual machine and user to\
          \ save and use data. The amount of\nstorage your virtual machine get are\
          \ dedicated, but the underlying storage\nsystem are shared. Furthermore,\
          \ not all storage is created equal, and Research\nCloud users have a few\
          \ different types of storage available which differ\naccording to performance,\
          \ persistence and data safety. \n On Virtual Machine Storage \n Each virtual\
          \ machine in the NeCTAR Cloud comes with a certain amount of built-in\n\
          storage and these storages are appeared as two separated hard disks\n(Root\
          \ Disk and Ephemeral Disk). These storage run off robust\nenterprise-grade\
          \ storage hardware on the back. However, both storage are not\nsuitable\
          \ for long-term persistent data as data will be lost after termination or\n\
          rebuilt of virtual machine. \n Root Disk \n This storage is used for operating\
          \ system of the virtual machine to boot it\ninto a functional state. It\
          \ has a limited 10GB in size, which is same for every\nstandard size of\
          \ virtual machine (Small, Medium, Large, Extra Large and\nExtra Extra Large).\
          \ The size various for non standard virtual machines such as\ntiny, which\
          \ only has 5GB root storage. \n Data stored on the root storage are persistent\
          \ until the termination or rebuilt\nof the virtual machine and are copied\
          \ during the snapshot. That means, if you\nreboot your virtual machine,\
          \ the data remains in tact and when you take a\npoint-in-time snapshot of\
          \ your virtual machine, the entire root storage is\ncopied. As the root\
          \ storage comes with fixed size and are used by the operation\nsystem, caution\
          \ need to be taken as it should not be filled in full. The name of\nthis\
          \ disk as seen from the virtual machine is usually /dev/vda. \n Ephemeral\
          \ Disk \n This storage appears as a second hard disk in your virtual machine\
          \ and are raw\nand unformatted block device, that you can format and use\
          \ as you wish. It varies\nin size according to the size of virtual machine\
          \ (from 0GB to 480GB). For every\nCPU an standard virtual machine will get\
          \ 30GB of additional ephemeral storage.\nIt various in size for non-standard\
          \ virtual machine. The name of this device as\nseen from the instance is\
          \ usually /dev/vdb and some operating systems will\nautomatically format\
          \ and mount the ephemeral disk. For example, Ubuntu creates\nan ext3 partition\
          \ and mounts it at /mnt. For operating system don't do it\nautomatically,\
          \ you can format it by executing mkfs.ext4 /dev/vdb in command line\nand\
          \ mount it by executing mount /dev/vdb /mnt. You also need to have root\n\
          permission to do that. \n Data stored on ephemeral disk are only persistent\
          \ until the termination or\nrebuilt of virtual machine, which are same as\
          \ the root disk. The only difference\nis data on ephemeral disk are not\
          \ copied when taking an snapshot of virtual\nmachine, which means you cannot\
          \ use snapshot to save data stored on ephemeral\ndisk. \n Backup of Ephemeral\
          \ Disk \n Data on the ephemeral disk does not get saved in a snapshot, and\
          \ requires other\ntechniques to make a backup. Other forms of storage can\
          \ be used such as the\nObject Store and Volume Storage within the Research\
          \ Cloud or external locations. \n Persistent Volume Storage \n Persistent\
          \ volume storage can live outside your virtual machine. It is appears\n\
          as block storage which can be attached then accessed and even booted from.\
          \ This\nis a storage volume that you can attach to from within your virtual\
          \ machine,\nrea and write data, detach it, and make it available to another\
          \ virtual machine.\nYour data on a persistent volume is retained even when\
          \ you terminate your\nvirtual machine. Persistent Volumes offer a snapshot\
          \ feature which can be used\nto make convenient backups (uses some of your\
          \ overall Persistent Volume quota). \n NOTE: Persistent Volumes are local\
          \ services and only virtual machines in the\navailability zone where the\
          \ persistent Volume has been created can access it. \n How to Get Persistent\
          \ Volume Storage \n By default, there are no persistent volume storage available\
          \ to your project.\nYou need to make an allocation request to apply for\
          \ how many persistent volume\nstorage you want to have for your project.\
          \ Follow the below steps to make a\nrequest: \n \n \n Login to NeCTAR Cloud\
          \ Dashboard \n \n \n Go to Allocations and you can either click 'New Request'\
          \ to make a new request\n or 'My Requests' to amend an existing request\
          \ \n \n \n Under section 'Storage Quota', you select 'Resource' as volume,\
          \ select the\n Zone you want the storage to be and enter the GB in the 'Requested\
          \ Quota'. \n \n \n Click 'Submit' button \n \n \n Note:\nIt would take a\
          \ while before your request get approved. \n Create a persistent volume\
          \ storage \n Once your request has been approved, your project should have\
          \ volume storage\navailable. You need to create volume storage in NeCTAR\
          \ Cloud Dashboard first\nbefore you can use it. \n \n \n Login to NeCTAR\
          \ Cloud Dashboard \n \n \n Go to 'Volumes' \n \n \n Click 'Create Volume'\
          \ button \n \n \n Give a Volume Name and meaningful description \n \n \n\
          \ Select a volume source, this is how volume get built. You can select\n\
          \ 'No source empty volume' to create new empty volume. You can select 'image'\
          \ to\n build a volume from a image or 'Volume' to build a volume from existing\
          \ volume \n \n \n Give size to volume in GB \n \n \n Give a availability\
          \ zone \n \n \n Click 'Create Volume' button \n \n \n Attach a persistent\
          \ volume storage \n you can attach the volume created earlier to a running\
          \ virtual machine. See the\nbelow instruction: \n \n \n Login to NeCTAR\

          \ \n Click 'Attach Volume' button \n \n \n Use Persistent Volume Storage\
          \ in Virtual Machine \n For a standard flavor virtual machine the persistent\
          \ volume will be attached\nas /dev/vdc. \n A new volume may not have a file\
          \ system (depending on how it was created) and\nyou need to create one before\
          \ mounting. \n The exact mount command syntax is dependent on the virtual\
          \ machine' operating\nsystem and the type of file system you require. \n\
          \ You can use below command to create file system on the new volume:\nsudo\
          \ mkfs.ext4 /dev/vdc \n WARNING: This can cause data loss if a file system\
          \ already exists on the target\nVolume. \n You can use below command to\
          \ mount the volume to /mnt\nsudo mount /dev/vdc /mnt -t auto \n Notes:\n\
          Volumes must be detached before deletion. \n Object Storage \n The NeCTAR\
          \ Cloud Object Storage is not a traditional file system, but rather a\n\
          distributed storage system for static data such as virtual machine images,\n\
          photo storage, email storage, backups and archives. Having no central \"\
          brain\" or\nmaster point of control provides greater scalability, redundancy\
          \ and durability.\nWhen you put a file in the NeCTAR Cloud Object Store,\
          \ 3 copies of your data are\ndistributed to different hardware for extra\
          \ data safety and performance. \n Think about that dataset comprised of\
          \ 2GB files that you read in and analyse\nmany times, but in general it\
          \ doesn't change. Or the images you want to use on\nthe cloud. Those are\
          \ a couple examples of what's perfect for Object Storage.\nObjects are written\
          \ to multiple hardware devices in the data center to ensure\nintegrity,\
          \ and great performance! \n In general, the object store is great for data\
          \ you write once and read many\ntimes, but not suitable for applications\
          \ like databases. It's the safest place\nto put your data on the NeCTAR\
          \ Research Cloud as multiple redundant copies of\nyour data are made, and\
          \ it has great performance. You can access the objec\nstore from anywhere\
          \ on the Internet, and data from Object Storage can be\ntransferred to and\
          \ from your virtual machine with a variety of http-capable\ntools. \n Object\
          \ Storage is completely decoupled from your virtual machine, so even if\
          \ you\nreboot, delete or crash your virtual machine, your Object Storage\
          \ files will\nremain safe (unless you remove them yourself). Object Storage\
          \ persists\nindependently from the life of an instance. \n Swift \n Swift\
          \ is the component that provides object storage for OpenStack. With your\n\
          credentials and via a URL you can request Swift to reserve & create storage\n\
          (called containers or buckets). Files (known as objects when stored in Swift)\n\
          can then be uploaded and accessed similarly by your running virtual machines.\
          \ \n The NeCTAR implementation of Swift is geodistributed across Nodes of\
          \ the NeCTAR\nCloud so that availability is not rely on any one data center\
          \ or network\ninfrastructure. Each collection of Swift nodes/hardware is\
          \ known as a region,\nwhich may or may not include a Swift proxy server\
          \ (the Internet facing and\nserving component of Swift). With some Swift\
          \ clients/APIs users can explicitly\nchose which proxy to connect to, this\
          \ might be useful e.g. for speeding up\nwrites to object storage by choosing\
          \ the nearest proxy. Due to NeCTAR's Swift\nhaving multiple regions (some\
          \ of which are Node private) some clients/APIs\nrequire explicit configuration\
          \ of a default region, which should be \"Melbourne\"\nfor most users. "

          <p>Each virtual machine in the NeCTAR Cloud comes with a certain amount\
          \ of built-in\nstorage and these storages are appeared as two separated\
          \ hard disks\n(Root Disk and Ephemeral Disk). These storage run off robust\n\
          enterprise-grade storage hardware on the back. However, both storage are\
          \ not\nsuitable for long-term persistent data as data will be lost after\
          \ termination or\nrebuilt of virtual machine.</p>\n<h3>Root Disk</h3>\n\
          <p>This storage is used for operating system of the virtual machine to boot\
          \ it\ninto a functional state. It has a limited 10GB in size, which is same\
          \ for every\nstandard size of virtual machine (Small, Medium, Large, Extra\
          \ Large and\nExtra Extra Large). The size various for non standard virtual\
          \ machines such as\ntiny, which only has 5GB root storage.</p>\n<p>Data\
          \ stored on the root storage are persistent until the termination or rebuilt\n\
          of the virtual machine and are copied during the snapshot. That means, if\
          \ you\nreboot your virtual machine, the data remains in tact and when you\
          \ take a\npoint-in-time snapshot of your virtual machine, the entire root\
          \ storage is\ncopied. As the root storage comes with fixed size and are\
          \ used by the operation\nsystem, caution need to be taken as it should not\
          \ be filled in full. The name of\nthis disk as seen from the virtual machine\
          \ is usually /dev/vda.</p>\n<h3>Ephemeral Disk</h3>\n<p>This storage appears\
          \ as a second hard disk in your virtual machine and are raw\nand unformatted\
          \ block device, that you can format and use as you wish. It varies\nin size\
          \ according to the size of virtual machine (from 0GB to 480GB). For every\n\
          CPU an standard virtual machine will get 30GB of additional ephemeral storage.\n\

          \ as\nseen from the instance is usually /dev/vdb and some operating systems\
          \ will\nautomatically format and mount the ephemeral disk. For example,\
          \ Ubuntu creates\nan ext3 partition and mounts it at /mnt. For operating\
          \ system don't do it\nautomatically, you can format it by executing mkfs.ext4\
          \ /dev/vdb in command line\nand mount it by executing mount /dev/vdb /mnt.\

    \ need to be taken as it should not be filled in full. The name of\nthis disk\
    \ as seen from the virtual machine is usually /dev/vda.</p>\n<h3>Ephemeral Disk</h3>\n\
    <p>This storage appears as a second hard disk in your virtual machine and are\
    \ raw\nand unformatted block device, that you can format and use as you wish.\
    \ It varies\nin size according to the size of virtual machine (from 0GB to 480GB).\
    \ For every\nCPU an standard virtual machine will get 30GB of additional ephemeral\
    \ storage.\nIt various in size for non-standard virtual machine. The name of this\
    \ device as\nseen from the instance is usually /dev/vdb and some operating systems\
    \ will\nautomatically format and mount the ephemeral disk. For example, Ubuntu\
    \ creates\nan ext3 partition and mounts it at /mnt. For operating system don't\
    \ do it\nautomatically, you can format it by executing mkfs.ext4 /dev/vdb in command\
    \ line\nand mount it by executing mount /dev/vdb /mnt. You also need to have root\n\
    permission to do that.</p>\n<p>Data stored on ephemeral disk are only persistent\
    \ until the termination or\nrebuilt of virtual machine, which are same as the\
    \ root disk. The only difference\nis data on ephemeral disk are not copied when\
    \ taking an snapshot of virtual\nmachine, which means you cannot use snapshot\
    \ to save data stored on ephemeral\ndisk.</p>\n<h4>Backup of Ephemeral Disk</h4>\n\
    <p>Data on the ephemeral disk does not get saved in a snapshot, and requires other\n\
    techniques to make a backup. Other forms of storage can be used such as the\n\
    Object Store and Volume Storage within the Research Cloud or external locations.</p>\n\
    <h2>Persistent Volume Storage</h2>\n<p>Persistent volume storage can live outside\
    \ your virtual machine. It is appears\nas block storage which can be attached\
    \ then accessed and even booted from. This\nis a storage volume that you can attach\
    \ to from within your virtual machine,\nrea and write data, detach it, and make\
    \ it available to another virtual machine.\nYour data on a persistent volume is\
    \ retained even when you terminate your\nvirtual machine. Persistent Volumes offer\
    \ a snapshot feature which can be used\nto make convenient backups (uses some\
    \ of your overall Persistent Volume quota).</p>\n<p>NOTE: Persistent Volumes are\
    \ local services and only virtual machines in the\navailability zone where the\
    \ persistent Volume has been created can access it.</p>\n<h3>How to Get Persistent\
    \ Volume Storage</h3>\n<p>By default, there are no persistent volume storage available\
    \ to your project.\nYou need to make an allocation request to apply for how many\
    \ persistent volume\nstorage you want to have for your project. Follow the below\
    \ steps to make a\nrequest:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Login to NeCTAR Cloud <a href=\"\
    https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au\">Dashboard</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Go to\
    \ Allocations and you can either click 'New Request' to make a new request\n or\
    \ 'My Requests' to amend an existing request</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Under section\
    \ 'Storage Quota', you select 'Resource' as volume, select the\n Zone you want\
    \ the storage to be and enter the GB in the 'Requested Quota'.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\
    <p>Click 'Submit' button</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note:\nIt would take a while before\
    \ your request get approved.</p>\n<h3>Create a persistent volume storage</h3>\n\
    <p>Once your request has been approved, your project should have volume storage\n\
    available. You need to create volume storage in NeCTAR Cloud Dashboard first\n\
    before you can use it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Login to NeCTAR Cloud <a href=\"https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au\"\
    >Dashboard</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Go to 'Volumes'</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click\
    \ 'Create Volume' button</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Give a Volume Name and meaningful\
    \ description</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Select a volume source, this is how volume\
    \ get built. You can select\n 'No source empty volume' to create new empty volume.\
    \ You can select 'image' to\n build a volume from a image or 'Volume' to build\
    \ a volume from existing volume</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Give size to volume in GB</p>\n\
    </li>\n<li>\n<p>Give a availability zone</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click 'Create Volume'\
    \ button</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Attach a persistent volume storage</h3>\n<p>you\
    \ can attach the volume created earlier to a running virtual machine. See the\n\
    below instruction:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Login to NeCTAR Cloud <a href=\"https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au\"\
    >Dashboard</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Go to 'Volumes'</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click\
    \ the action list of volume</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click 'Edit Attachment'</p>\n\
    </li>\n<li>\n<p>Click 'Attach to Instance' drop down list to select a virtual\
    \ machine to\n attach a volume</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click 'Attach Volume' button</p>\n\
    </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Use Persistent Volume Storage in Virtual Machine</h3>\n<p>For\
    \ a standard flavor virtual machine the persistent volume will be attached\nas\
    \ /dev/vdc.</p>\n<p>A new volume may not have a file system (depending on how\
    \ it was created) and\nyou need to create one before mounting.</p>\n<p>The exact\
    \ mount command syntax is dependent on the virtual machine' operating\nsystem\
    \ and the type of file system you require.</p>\n<p>You can use below command to\
    \ create file system on the new volume:\nsudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/vdc</p>\n<p>WARNING:\
    \ This can cause data loss if a file system already exists on the target\nVolume.</p>\n\
    <p>You can use below command to mount the volume to /mnt\nsudo mount /dev/vdc\
    \ /mnt -t auto</p>\n<p>Notes:\nVolumes must be detached before deletion.</p>\n\
    <h2>Object Storage</h2>\n<p>The NeCTAR Cloud Object Storage is not a traditional\
    \ file system, but rather a\ndistributed storage system for static data such as\
    \ virtual machine images,\nphoto storage, email storage, backups and archives.\
    \ Having no central \"brain\" or\nmaster point of control provides greater scalability,\
    \ redundancy and durability.\nWhen you put a file in the NeCTAR Cloud Object Store,\
    \ 3 copies of your data are\ndistributed to different hardware for extra data\
    \ safety and performance.</p>\n<p>Think about that dataset comprised of 2GB files\
    \ that you read in and analyse\nmany times, but in general it doesn't change.\
    \ Or the images you want to use on\nthe cloud. Those are a couple examples of\
    \ what's perfect for Object Storage.\nObjects are written to multiple hardware\
    \ devices in the data center to ensure\nintegrity, and great performance!</p>\n\
    <p>In general, the object store is great for data you write once and read many\n\
    times, but not suitable for applications like databases. It's the safest place\n\
    to put your data on the NeCTAR Research Cloud as multiple redundant copies of\n\
    your data are made, and it has great performance. You can access the objec\nstore\
    \ from anywhere on the Internet, and data from Object Storage can be\ntransferred\
    \ to and from your virtual machine with a variety of http-capable\ntools.</p>\n\
    <p>Object Storage is completely decoupled from your virtual machine, so even if\
    \ you\nreboot, delete or crash your virtual machine, your Object Storage files\
    \ will\nremain safe (unless you remove them yourself). Object Storage persists\n\
    independently from the life of an instance.</p>\n<h3>Swift</h3>\n<p>Swift is the\
    \ component that provides object storage for OpenStack. With your\ncredentials\
    \ and via a URL you can request Swift to reserve &amp; create storage\n(called\
    \ containers or buckets). Files (known as objects when stored in Swift)\ncan then\
    \ be uploaded and accessed similarly by your running virtual machines.</p>\n<p>The\
    \ NeCTAR implementation of Swift is geodistributed across Nodes of the NeCTAR\n\
    Cloud so that availability is not rely on any one data center or network\ninfrastructure.\
    \ Each collection of Swift nodes/hardware is known as a region,\nwhich may or\
    \ may not include a Swift proxy server (the Internet facing and\nserving component\
    \ of Swift). With some Swift clients/APIs users can explicitly\nchose which proxy\
    \ to connect to, this might be useful e.g. for speeding up\nwrites to object storage\
    \ by choosing the nearest proxy. Due to NeCTAR's Swift\nhaving multiple regions\
    \ (some of which are Node private) some clients/APIs\nrequire explicit configuration\
    \ of a default region, which should be \"Melbourne\"\nfor most users.</p>"

          \ to our instances. An ssh key pair is required to encrypt the data which\
          \ is transferred to communicate with the instance. The pair consists of\
          \ two keys: A private key, and a public key.  The public key is called \"\
          public\" because that\u2019s the one which is placed on the server and which\
          \ you may upload online without worrying about security issues. It is useless\

          \ key which you keep on your local computer so that you may connect to the\
          \ instance. You should keep the private key very safe and never share it\
          \ with anyone. Take care not to lose it, otherwise you won\u2019t be able\
          \ to connect to your machine. The connection to the machine only works with\
          \ both keys. \n \nThe image above shows two computers connected through\
          \ their ports, with an ssh server and client encrypting the connection.\
          \ Applications can use this secure ssh connection to exchange data.  \n\
          \ We will first have to generate this key pair before we can proceed with\
          \ launching an instance. \n The ssh keys will have a name. You should choose\
          \ a name that you can associate with your instance, for example \"Nectar_Key\"\
          . As a general rule of thumb, file names should consist of alphanumeric\
          \ characters and underscores ( _ ) only. You should avoid white spaces.\
          \ They makes working with files on Unix systems a bit clumsy. \n Note: The\
          \ process differs between Unix/Mac Systems and Windows. Follow the steps\
          \ described below for your platform, and then continue to the next section.\
          \ \n Mac and Linux \n SSH key pairs can be generated with the ssh-keygen\
          \ command. \n If you choose Nectar_Key as your key name, you will have two\
          \ files after the generation of keys: The private key, called Nectar_Key\
          \ and the public key, called Nectar_Key.pub. \n Open your Unix or Mac Terminal.\
          \ You will start off in your \"home\" directory. If you already had the\
          \ terminal open before, make sure you are in the home directory, by simply\
          \ typing  \n cd \n Now, check if you already have a directory called .ssh,\
          \ by typing     \n ls -a     \n A list of files in your home directory will\
          \ be printed. If you don\u2019t see the name .ssh in this list, create the\
          \ directory (if you see the directory, skip this command):     \n mkdir\
          \ .ssh     \n and change to this directory:     \n cd .ssh      \n Now generate\
          \ the key with     \n ssh-keygen -t rsa -f Nectar_Key     \n This generates\
          \ a pair of keys in the directory .ssh, which is the default location for\
          \ ssh keys.   \nYou will be asked to specify a passphrase. Choose a secure\
          \ passphrase! But make sure that you store your password somewhere safe\
          \ - you will not be able to connect to your instance if you forget the password!\
          \ \n You will have generated (1) a key you keep private, named Nectar_Key\
          \ and (2) a public key, named Nectar_Key.pub. If you type \n ls \n Then\
          \ you should see both files listed. \n Open the public key file with your\
          \ favourite text editor. If you don\u2019t have a favourite editor, here\
          \ are some suggestions:   \nOn a Mac, type     \n open -e Nectar_Key.pub\
          \     \n which should open the key in TextEdit.    \nOn a Linux gnome environment\
          \ (e.g. Unity), type     \n gedit Nectar_Key     \n or if you are using\
          \ KDE, type      \n kate Nectar_Key     \n If you are using another desktop\
          \ environment we assume you are familiar with your favourite text editor.\
          \ \n Copy all the text which is contained in the file Nectar_Key.pub into\
          \ the clipboard. With CTRL+A you can mark all text, and with CTRL+C copy\
          \ it (on a Mac it is Command (\u2318) instead of CTRL). You will need the\
          \ contents of the public key on the keyboard in one of the next steps. \
          \ \n Windows \n Open the PuTTYgen program by clicking on PuTTYgen.exe which\
          \ you downloaded in the beginning of this tutorial. \n \n For Type of key\
          \ to generate, select SSH-2 RSA. \n Click on Generate.  \n Move your mouse\
          \ in the area below the progress bar. When the progress bar is full, PuTTYgen\
          \ generates your key pair. \n \n\n \n Type a passphrase in the Key passphrase\
          \ field. Choose a secure passphrase! Type the same passphrase in the Confirm\
          \ passphrase field. \n Right-click in the text field \"Public key for pasting\
          \ into OpenSSH authorized_keys file\" and choose Select All. Right-click\
          \ again in the same text field and choose Copy. This copies the content\
          \ onto the clipboard, we will need to paste it somewhere else in one of\
          \ the next steps. \n Click the Save private key button to save the private\
          \ key. It is important that you save the key, because you will need the\
          \ file later. So save it in a folder where you can find it again. In this\
          \ exercise, we will name the file Nectar_Key.ppk.  \n Save your public key\
          \ as well by clicking the Save public key button. As a file name, type Nectar_Key.pub.txt. "

  html: "<p>First, we will need to create a <strong>ssh key pair</strong> for connecting\
    \ to our instances. An ssh key pair is required to encrypt the data which is transferred\
    \ to communicate with the instance. The pair consists of two keys: A <em>private</em>\
    \ key, and a <em>public</em> key.  The public key is called \"public\" because\
    \ that\u2019s the one which is placed on the server and which you may upload online\
    \ without worrying about security issues. It is useless without its counterpart,\
    \ the <em>private</em> key. The private key is the secret key which you keep on\
    \ your local computer so that you may connect to the instance. You should keep\
    \ the private key very safe and never share it with anyone. Take care not to lose\
    \ it, otherwise you won\u2019t be able to connect to your machine. The connection\
    \ to the machine only works with both keys.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"images/sshKeys.png\"\
    >\nThe image above shows two computers connected through their <em>ports</em>,\
    \ with an ssh server and client encrypting the connection. Applications can use\
    \ this secure ssh connection to exchange data. </p>\n<p>We will first have to\
    \ generate this key pair before we can proceed with launching an instance.</p>\n\
    <p>The ssh keys will have a <em>name</em>. You should choose a name that you can\
    \ associate with your instance, for example \"<em>Nectar_Key\"</em>. As a general\
    \ rule of thumb, file names should consist of alphanumeric characters and underscores\
    \ ( _ ) only. You should avoid white spaces. They makes working with files on\
    \ Unix systems a bit clumsy.</p>\n<p><em>Note:</em> The process differs between\
    \ Unix/Mac Systems and Windows. Follow the steps described below for your platform,\
    \ and then continue to the next section.</p>\n<h3>Mac and Linux</h3>\n<p>SSH key\
    \ pairs can be generated with the <em>ssh-keygen</em> command.</p>\n<p>If you\
    \ choose <em>Nectar_Key</em> as your key name, you will have two files after the\
    \ generation of keys: The private key, called <em>Nectar_Key</em> and the public\
    \ key, called <em>Nectar_Key.pub</em>.</p>\n<p>Open your Unix or Mac Terminal.\

          \ we can access the storage remotely and directly from our instance. \n\
          \ General notes \n What is an \"instance\" \n In Module 5 we have already\
          \ discussed in more detail what an instance is, but let\u2019s do a little\
          \ recap at this point. \nIn the NeCTAR Research Cloud, an instance is a\

          \ like real-life computers, except that they run remotely, \"in the Cloud\"\
          . Here and when learning about them on the web, you will often find them\
          \ referred to as \"instances\".  \n Instance vs \"local computer\" \n In\
          \ this document we will often talk about the \"local computer\" as opposed\
          \ to the \u201Cinstance\u201D. The local computer is the one you are probably\
          \ sitting in front of right now: It is your home or office computer that\
          \ you use to connect to the instance. The instance is your virtual machine\
          \ that is running in the NeCTAR cloud. \n You may be familiar with connecting\
          \ to remote computers already. You may have connected to a remote desktop,\
          \ or used a command line. The same tools and techniques apply when connecting\
          \ to running instances. Your instance has a public IP address and can be\
          \ reached and controlled with any remote access tools you wish to use, after\
          \ you have set it up for remote access. For example, you can use an SSH\
          \ terminal, or alternatively connect to your remote desktop.  \n In this\

          \ will be referred to as the \"ssh terminal\". \n \n The Windows command\
          \ line on your computer.  You can open it by typing \"cmd\" into the search\
          \ field (on Windows < 8 on \"Start\"; on Windows 8 in the \"App search\"\
          \ field).  \n \n This Terminal will be referred to as your \"local Terminal\"\
          . \n On Mac and Linux, there are built-in terminals available. You can access\
          \ them as follows: \n \n \n On Linux Systems, depending on your desktop\
          \ environment, opening a terminal is usually achieved by clicking on the\

          .  \n \n \n On a Mac, you can open a terminal as follows:  \n \n \n Bring\
          \ up \"Spotlight Search\" by holding down the \"Command\" and \"Spacebar\"\

  html: "<p>In this module we are going to learn how to launch an instance and how\
    \ to connect to it. We are going to discuss two ways to connect: (a) with the\
    \ command line and (b) to a remote desktop, with the benefits of having a graphical\
    \ interface. We will briefly take a look at how to run graphical applications\
    \ via the command line (instead of the remote desktop), and we will also set up\
    \ a web server to publish a very simple website. Finally, we will set up the different\
    \ cloud storage types, so we can access the storage remotely and directly from\
    \ our instance.</p>\n<h3>General notes</h3>\n<h3>What is an \"instance\"</h3>\n\
    <p>In Module 5 we have already discussed in more detail what an instance is, but\
    \ let\u2019s do a little recap at this point. \nIn the NeCTAR Research Cloud,\
    \ an instance is a virtual machine.\nInstances running inside the Research Cloud\
    \ are just like real-life computers, except that they run remotely, \"in the Cloud\"\
    . Here and when learning about them on the web, you will often find them referred\
    \ to as \"instances\". </p>\n<h3>Instance <em>vs</em> \"local computer\"</h3>\n\
    <p>In this document we will often talk about the \"local computer\" as opposed\
    \ to the \u201Cinstance\u201D. The local computer is the one you are probably\
    \ sitting in front of right now: It is your home or office computer that you use\
    \ to connect to the instance. The instance is your virtual machine that is running\
    \ in the NeCTAR cloud.</p>\n<p>You may be familiar with connecting to remote computers\
    \ already. You may have connected to a remote desktop, or used a command line.\
    \ The same tools and techniques apply when connecting to running instances. Your\
    \ instance has a public IP address and can be reached and controlled with any\
    \ remote access tools you wish to use, after you have set it up for remote access.\
    \ For example, you can use an SSH terminal, or alternatively connect to your remote\
    \ desktop. </p>\n<p>In this module we will create and launch an instance (a virtual\
    \ machine, short: VM) and go through the two options on how you can connect to\
    \ your instance (terminal and remote desktop). </p>\n<h3>Use of Terminals</h3>\n\
    <p>Throughout the exercises, we will use a Terminal to type commands. To prepare,\
    \ make sure you know how to open your Terminal by following instructions below\
    \ for your Operating System. </p>\n<p>On <strong>Windows</strong>, you will use\
    \ two terminals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>PuTTY</strong> terminal to connect\
    \ to and type commands for the instance. You will need to download PuTTY:</li>\n\
    </ul>\n<p>You will need the files <em>PuTTYgen.exe</em> and the file <em>Putty.exe</em>\
    \ from the\n<a href=\"http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html\"\
    >official PuTTY website</a>.</p>\n<p>This Terminal will be referred to as the\
    \ <strong>\"ssh terminal\"</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>Windows command\
    \ line</strong> on your computer.  You can open it by typing \"cmd\" into the\
    \ search field (on Windows &lt; 8 on \"Start\"; on Windows 8 in the \"App search\"\
    \ field). </li>\n</ul>\n<p>This Terminal will be referred to as your <strong>\"\
    local Terminal\"</strong>.</p>\n<p>On <strong>Mac and Linux</strong>, there are\
    \ built-in terminals available. You can access them as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n\
    <p>On <strong>Linux</strong> Systems, depending on your desktop environment, opening\
    \ a terminal is usually achieved by clicking on the terminal symbol, or by right\
    \ click on the desktop and select \"<em>Open Terminal</em>\". </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\
    <p>On a <strong>Mac</strong>, you can open a terminal as follows: </p>\n<ul>\n\
    <li>\n<p>Bring up \"Spotlight Search\" by holding down the \"Command\" and \"\
    Spacebar\" keys simultaneously.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In the search box that appears,\
    \ type \"Terminal\" and press the Return key.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Alternatively,\
    \ in the <em>Finder</em>, go to <em>Applications &gt; Utilities</em> and you will\
    \ find the Terminal app there.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>"
