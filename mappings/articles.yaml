        desc_un_html: " This guide describes launching a running instance (virtual\
          \ machine) with SSH login\nenabled. \n Preparation \n You need to create\
          \ a public/private key pair before you can use SSH to login to \nthe newly\
          \ created instance. The public key will be inserted into the instance and\n\
          the private key is used on your desktop/laptop. \n Windows User \n Use PuTTYgen\
          \ key generator to generate the required key pair. \n \n \n Download PuTTYgen\
          \ (puttygen.exe) from PuTTYgen download page \n \n \n Launch the PuTTYgen\
          \ application by double clicking the puttygen.exe \n \n \n The default settings\
          \ are fine for this case, click the 'Generate' button \n \n \n Save your\
          \ public key by clicking 'Save public key' button. You should give a\n name\
          \ that will help identify the key in the future \n \n \n Save your private\
          \ key by clicking 'Save private key' button. You should give\n a sensible\
          \ name for future reference. The passphrase can provide additional\n security,\
          \ though can be left empty. \n \n \n Linux/Mac User \n Type ssh-keygen in\
          \ the terminal and enter. This generates a public key\n(id_rsa.pub) and\
          \ a private key (id_rsa). By default, the two keys are\nlocated in ~/.ssh\
          \ \n Import Public Key \n The public key generated by Windows/Linux/Mac\
          \ are required to be imported into\nthe Nectar Cloud dashboard before use.\
          \ \n \n \n Log into the Cloud Dashboard \n \n \n Go to the Access and Security\
          \ tab and then to the Keypairs page \n \n \n Click 'Import Key Pair' button\
          \ \n \n \n Type in a keypair name and paste the contents of the public key.\
          \ For Windows\n users, open PuTTYgen and click 'Load' button to load the\
          \ related private key and\n copy/paste the public key contents. For Linux/Mac\
          \ user, type\n cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub and copy/paste the public key contents\
          \ from the terminal\n output \n \n \n Nectar Cloud Dashboard \n Key pairs\
          \ can also be created directly through the Nectar Cloud Dashboard. \n \n\
          \ \n Login to the Cloud Dashboard \n \n \n Go to the Access and Security\
          \ tab and then to the Keypairs page \n \n \n Click the 'Create Key Pair'\
          \ button \n \n \n Type in a keypair name in the popup window and click the\
          \ 'Create Key Pair'\n button \n \n \n Save the private key into a directory\
          \ \n \n \n Notes: If you are running a Windows machine the SSH private key\
          \ will need to be\nconverted (use PuTTYgen for converting keys) \n \n \n\
          \ Open PuTTYgen \n \n \n Click 'Load' button to load the private key generated\
          \ by the Cloud Dashboard \n \n \n Click 'Export OpenSSH key' from 'Conversions'\
          \ menu \n \n \n Type a private key name and save \n \n \n Select an Image\
          \ \n You need to select an image to be used for your instance. The image\
          \ defines what\noperating system the instance uses and thus you need to\
          \ select an image based on\nyour needs. Nectar Cloud offers a list of official\
          \ images and for\nsimplicity, these images are recommended. You can find\
          \ a complete list of\nofficial images from Nectar image catalog. You can\
          \ also find all\navailable images from the Cloud Dashboard. \n \n \n Login\
          \ to the Cloud Dashboard \n \n \n Go to the Dashboard Images tab \n \n \n\
          \ For advanced users, you can also create your own images. Please refer\
          \ to\nthe openstack documentation for more details. \n Configure Instance\
          \ \n Before you can launch an instance, you need to configure the below\
          \ options: \n Details \n \n \n Instance Name: the name used by the dashboard\
          \ to identify the instance \n \n \n Flavour: the resources available for\
          \ the instance. It specifies the number of\n VCPUs, size of root disk, size\
          \ of ephemeral disk and size of RAM.\n Your allocated flavour or lesser\
          \ configurations can be selected (the\n default is m2.tiny; a 1 VCPU machine)\
          \ \n \n \n Instance Count: number of instance to launch (the default is\
          \ 1) \n \n \n Instance Boot Source: the media used to boot the instance.\
          \ You can boot from\n image, snapshot and volume (the default is boot from\
          \ image) \n \n \n Boot from image: Boot instance using an image \n \n \n\
          \ Boot from snapshot: Boot instance using a snapshot \n \n \n Boot from\
          \ volume: Boot instance from volume storage \n \n \n Image Name: the name\
          \ of an Image. This option is used when the Instance Boot\n Source is 'Boot\
          \ from image' \n \n \n Access & Security \n \n \n Key Pair: the public/private\
          \ keys used to log into the instance. See above to\n see how to create them.\
          \ This can't be added or changed after the instance is\n created. \n \n\
          \ \n Security Groups: add network access to your instances. This determines\
          \ what\n services can be accessed on the instance. You must select 'SSH'\
          \ Security Groups\n to allow you to login via SSH. If 'SSH' Security Groups\
          \ is not available, you\n can create it by going to Access & Security tab\
          \ on the right hand side of the\n Cloud Dashboard. The default Security\
          \ Group (no network access at first) is\n pre-selected \n \n \n To create\
          \ a Security Group: \n \n \n Login to the Cloud Dashboard \n \n \n Go to\
          \ the Access & Security tab \n \n \n Click 'Create Security Group' button\
          \ \n \n \n Give a name for the Security Group \n \n \n Give a meaningful\
          \ description for the Security Group \n \n \n Click 'Create Security Group'\
          \ button \n \n \n The newly created Security Group has no rules added (no\
          \ network access defined).\nTo add rules to a Security Group: \n \n \n Go\
          \ to the Access & Security tab \n \n \n Tick to select the Security Group\
          \ to add rules \n \n \n Click 'Manage Rules' button \n \n \n Click 'Add\
          \ Rule' button \n \n \n Select what type of Rule you want to create \n \n\
          \ \n Select from 'Open Port' the 'Port' option to open one single port,\
          \ or 'Port Range'\n to open a range of ports \n \n \n The 'Remote' option\
          \ specifies the source of the traffic to be allowed via this\n rule. You\
          \ may do so either in the form of an IP address block (CIDR) or via a\n\
          \ source group (Security Group). \n \n \n Click 'Add' button \n \n \n You\
          \ can also click 'Delete Rule' button to delete a rule \n Availability Zone\
          \ \n Select the Availability Zone for your instance. The Availability Zone\
          \ is the\nlocation for your instance. By default, the system will select\
          \ an available\nlocation for you. You can also click the 'Advanced' button\
          \ to select from a\ncomplete list of available Availability Zones \n Post-Creation\
          \ \n You can execute a customization script after you launch your instance.\
          \ You can\ndo any initialization and customization to your instance by using\
          \ this and it\nis executed only once at the first boot of your instance.\
          \ You can copy/paste\nyour script by selecting 'Direct Input' or you can\
          \ upload a script file. The\nscript can be a shell script or Cloud-init\
          \ script. \n Advanced Options \n You can choose whether you automaticly\
          \ or manually create the disk partition.\nIn most cases, you shouldn't change\
          \ the default. \n Notes: The above configuration options can be set in the\
          \ 'Launch Instance' popup\nwindow. To launch the popup window, you can go\
          \ to the Instances tab and\nclick 'Launch Instance' button. \n To get more\
          \ information about the terms used, please refer to\nthe glossary. \n Example\
          \ Launch of an Instance \n \n \n Login to the Cloud Dashboard \n \n \n Go\
          \ to Dashboard Instances tab \n \n \n Click 'Launch Instance' button \n\
          \ \n \n Type instance name \n \n \n Select a flavour. Flavour indicates\
          \ the specification of a instance. You can\n find more information in the\
          \ Flavour Details. \n \n \n Select an NeCTAR offical image (we suggest selecting\
          \ an Ubuntu image such as\n NeCTAR Ubuntu 14.10 (Utopic) amd64) \n \n \n\
          \ Click Access & Security tab \n \n \n Select a key pair created earlier\
          \ \n \n \n Select security groups to use. Tick 'ssh' and 'http' (these are\
          \ pre-defined\n groups in the default personal project) \n \n \n Click Availability\
          \ Zone \n \n \n Select the location of your instance or leave as unselected\
          \ (the system will\n auto select available location) \n \n \n Click launch\
          \ button and the page will change to the Instances Tab \n \n \n After a\
          \ while (usually a couple of minutes), your instance will become active\n\
          \ and will have an IP address. The IP address is available in the Instances\
          \ table\n on your Nectar Dashboard. \n \n \n The launch button begins Cloud\
          \ provisioning and initialisation of a running\ninstance from the selected\
          \ image and your configuration options. The instance\nwill normally pass\
          \ from status \"Build\" to \"Active\". Depending on your image\nsize and\
          \ cloud activity, the length of time required may vary. Your instance\n\
          will have a public IP address and be reachable according to the\nSecurity\
          \ Groups selected. \n You can connect to your new instance via\nAccessing\
          \ Your Instance \n If Launch is Unsuccessful \n You may get a message that\
          \ your quota has been exceeded or you have\ninsufficient resources. Check\
          \ the table to the right on the Launch Instance page\nfor the number of\
          \ instances you may run simultaneously, then check the\nInstances tab to\
          \ see how many Instances you already have running. You may have\nto terminate\
          \ a running Instance to free resources before you can launch another\n(see\
          \ Instance tab to Terminate). If you need more resources see the allocation\n\
          tab to apply for an increase. \n If the above doesn't apply to you, alternatively,\
          \ you can send an email to the\nCloud Help Desk. Please find how to lodge\
          \ a support ticket from\nNectar Support. "

  html: "<p>This guide describes launching a running instance (virtual machine) with\
    \ SSH login\nenabled.</p>\n<h2>Preparation</h2>\n<p>You need to create a public/private\
    \ key pair before you can use SSH to login to \nthe newly created instance. The\
    \ public key will be inserted into the instance and\nthe private key is used on\
    \ your desktop/laptop.</p>\n<h3>Windows User</h3>\n<p>Use PuTTYgen key generator\
    \ to generate the required key pair.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Download PuTTYgen (<code>puttygen.exe</code>)\
    \ from <a href=\"http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html\"\
    >PuTTYgen download page</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Launch the PuTTYgen application\
    \ by double clicking the <code>puttygen.exe</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The default\
    \ settings are fine for this case, click the 'Generate' button</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\
    <p>Save your public key by clicking 'Save public key' button. You should give\
    \ a\n name that will help identify the key in the future</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Save\
    \ your private key by clicking 'Save private key' button. You should give\n a\
    \ sensible name for future reference. The passphrase can provide additional\n\
    \ security, though can be left empty.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Linux/Mac User</h3>\n\
    <p>Type <code>ssh-keygen</code> in the terminal and enter. This generates a public\
    \ key\n(<code>id_rsa.pub</code>) and a private key (<code>id_rsa</code>). By default,\
    \ the two keys are\nlocated in <code>~/.ssh</code></p>\n<h3>Import Public Key</h3>\n\
    <p>The public key generated by Windows/Linux/Mac are required to be imported into\n\
    the Nectar Cloud dashboard before use.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Log into the <a href=\"\
    https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au\">Cloud Dashboard</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Go\
    \ to the Access and Security tab and then to the Keypairs page</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\
    <p>Click 'Import Key Pair' button</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Type in a keypair name\
    \ and paste the contents of the public key. For Windows\n users, open PuTTYgen\
    \ and click 'Load' button to load the related private key and\n copy/paste the\
    \ public key contents. For Linux/Mac user, type\n cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub and copy/paste\
    \ the public key contents from the terminal\n output</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Nectar\
    \ Cloud Dashboard</h3>\n<p>Key pairs can also be created directly through the\
    \ Nectar Cloud Dashboard.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Login to the <a href=\"https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au\"\
    >Cloud Dashboard</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Go to the Access and Security tab and\
    \ then to the Keypairs page</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click the 'Create Key Pair' button</p>\n\
    </li>\n<li>\n<p>Type in a keypair name in the popup window and click the 'Create\
    \ Key Pair'\n button</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Save the private key into a directory</p>\n\
    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Notes: If you are running a Windows machine the SSH private key\
    \ will need to be\nconverted (use PuTTYgen for converting keys)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n\
    <p>Open PuTTYgen</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click 'Load' button to load the private\
    \ key generated by the Cloud Dashboard</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click 'Export OpenSSH\
    \ key' from 'Conversions' menu</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Type a private key name and\
    \ save</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Select an Image</h2>\n<p>You need to select an image\
    \ to be used for your instance. The image defines what\noperating system the instance\
    \ uses and thus you need to select an image based on\nyour needs. Nectar Cloud\
    \ offers a list of official images and for\nsimplicity, these images are recommended.\
    \ You can find a complete list of\nofficial images from <a href=\"https://wiki.rc.nectar.org.au/wiki/Image_Catalog\"\
    >Nectar image catalog</a>. You can also find all\navailable images from the <a\
    \ href=\"https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au\">Cloud Dashboard</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n\
    <li>\n<p>Login to the <a href=\"https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au\">Cloud Dashboard</a></p>\n\
    </li>\n<li>\n<p>Go to the Dashboard Images tab</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For advanced\
    \ users, you can also create your own images. Please refer to\nthe <a href=\"\
    http://docs.openstack.org/image-guide/content/ch_creating_images_manually.html\"\
    >openstack documentation</a> for more details.</p>\n<h2>Configure Instance</h2>\n\
    <p>Before you can launch an instance, you need to configure the below options:</p>\n\
    <h3>Details</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Instance Name: the name used by the dashboard\
    \ to identify the instance</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Flavour: the resources available\
    \ for the instance. It specifies the number of\n VCPUs, size of root disk, size\
    \ of ephemeral disk and size of RAM.\n Your allocated flavour or lesser configurations\
    \ can be selected (the\n default is m2.tiny; a 1 VCPU machine)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\
    <p>Instance Count: number of instance to launch (the default is 1)</p>\n</li>\n\
    <li>\n<p>Instance Boot Source: the media used to boot the instance. You can boot\
    \ from\n image, snapshot and volume (the default is boot from image)</p>\n</li>\n\
    <li>\n<p>Boot from image: Boot instance using an image</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Boot\
    \ from snapshot: Boot instance using a snapshot</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Boot from\
    \ volume: Boot instance from volume storage</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Image Name: the\
    \ name of an Image. This option is used when the Instance Boot\n Source is 'Boot\
    \ from image'</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Access &amp; Security</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n\
    <p>Key Pair: the public/private keys used to log into the instance. See above\
    \ to\n see how to create them. This can't be added or changed after the instance\
    \ is\n created.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Security Groups: add network access to your\
    \ instances. This determines what\n services can be accessed on the instance.\
    \ You must select 'SSH' Security Groups\n to allow you to login via SSH. If 'SSH'\
    \ Security Groups is not available, you\n can create it by going to Access &amp;\
    \ Security tab on the right hand side of the\n Cloud Dashboard. The default Security\
    \ Group (no network access at first) is\n pre-selected</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To\
    \ create a Security Group:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Login to the <a href=\"https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au\"\
    >Cloud Dashboard</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Go to the Access &amp; Security tab</p>\n\
    </li>\n<li>\n<p>Click 'Create Security Group' button</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Give\
    \ a name for the Security Group</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Give a meaningful description\
    \ for the Security Group</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click 'Create Security Group' button</p>\n\
    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>The newly created Security Group has no rules added (no network\
    \ access defined).\nTo add rules to a Security Group:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Go to\
    \ the Access &amp; Security tab</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tick to select the Security\
    \ Group to add rules</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click 'Manage Rules' button</p>\n</li>\n\
    <li>\n<p>Click 'Add Rule' button</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Select what type of Rule\
    \ you want to create</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Select from 'Open Port' the 'Port' option\
    \ to open one single port, or 'Port Range'\n to open a range of ports</p>\n</li>\n\
    <li>\n<p>The 'Remote' option specifies the source of the traffic to be allowed\
    \ via this\n rule. You may do so either in the form of an IP address block (CIDR)\
    \ or via a\n source group (Security Group).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click 'Add' button</p>\n\
    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can also click 'Delete Rule' button to delete a rule</p>\n\
    <h3>Availability Zone</h3>\n<p>Select the Availability Zone for your instance.\
    \ The Availability Zone is the\nlocation for your instance. By default, the system\

    \ button to select from a\ncomplete list of available Availability Zones</p>\n\
    <h3>Post-Creation</h3>\n<p>You can execute a customization script after you launch\
    \ your instance. You can\ndo any initialization and customization to your instance\
    \ by using this and it\nis executed only once at the first boot of your instance.\
    \ You can copy/paste\nyour script by selecting 'Direct Input' or you can upload\
    \ a script file. The\nscript can be a shell script or Cloud-init script.</p>\n\
    <h3>Advanced Options</h3>\n<p>You can choose whether you automaticly or manually\
    \ create the disk partition.\nIn most cases, you shouldn't change the default.</p>\n\
    <p>Notes: The above configuration options can be set in the 'Launch Instance'\
    \ popup\nwindow. To launch the popup window, you can go to the Instances tab and\n\
    click 'Launch Instance' button.</p>\n<p>To get more information about the terms\

          \ Access to the Nectar\nCloud is enabled by the Australian Access Federation\
          \ (AAF). \n AAF Authentication \n Your AAF credentials are the same as your\
          \ institutional username and password.\nTo check that your organisation\
          \ is a member of the AAF check the\ncomplete AAF member list here. \n If\
          \ your institution is not a member of the AAF, talk to your local IT team\n\
          to arrange access. \n Logging in \n Once you have obtained your AAF credentials,\
          \ you can follow these steps to\nlogin to NeCTAR Dashboard: \n \n \n Click\
          \ 'log in' \n \n \n In dropdown list, select the name of your research institution\
          \ \n \n \n Click 'Select' \n \n \n Wait until the selected institutional\
          \ login page appears \n \n \n Type in your username and password \n \n \n\
          \ Click 'Continue' \n \n \n If you have any issues contact the Nectar help\
          \ team. \n API Credentials \n The first time you login to the dashboard\
          \ a NeCTAR Cloud account is created\nfor you. You will need this account\
          \ if you want to access the Cloud outside of\nthe dashboard through the\
          \ API. The API is a programming interface providing\nmore flexibility of\
          \ utilising the power of the cloud. \n There are two types of API credentials\
          \ and which one you use will depend on\nthe API client you use. The below\
          \ section only works for Linux/Unix users. \n Openstack API \n It requires\
          \ 6 variables to be set in order to authenticate against\nthe NeCTAR Cloud:\
          \ \n \n \n OS_AUTH_URL: authentication URL \n \n \n OS_TENANT_ID: tenant\
          \ id \n \n \n OS_TENANT_NAME: tenant name (optional) \n \n \n OS_USERNAME:\
          \ username \n \n \n OS_PASSWORD: password \n \n \n OS_REGION_NAME:  location\
          \ of your configuration (optional) \n \n \n You can set these variables\
          \ through\nenvironment variables. For example: \n OS_AUTH_URL: URL \n OS_TENANT_NAME=my_science_project\
          \ \n OS_USERNAME=clouduser@example.edu.au \n OS_PASSWORD=XXXXXX \n If you\
          \ are a member of multiple projects (tenants) you may also want to set:\n\
          OS_NO_CACHE=True \n The Dashboard provides a convenient way to help you\
          \ setting up these variables\nvia a shell script file. You can follow the\
          \ below steps to obtain it: \n \n \n Go To Dashboard \n \n \n Login to dashboard\
          \ via AAF Credentials \n \n \n Click 'Access & Security' \n \n \n Click\
          \ 'API Access' tap \n \n \n Click 'Download OpenStack RC File' \n \n \n\
          \ Save the shell script file in your local computer/laptop \n \n \n The\
          \ password is not automatically set for you for security reason. You can\
          \ also\nobtain the API password from NeCTAR cloud. Please follow the below\
          \ steps to get\nthe password: \n \n \n Go To Dashboard \n \n \n Login to\
          \ dashboard via AAF Credentials \n \n \n On the right top of the page, click\
          \ drop down list containing your email\n address \n \n \n Click 'Settings'\
          \ \n \n \n Click 'Reset Password' button \n \n \n The copy/paste the password\
          \ appeared on the screen to a text file, then save\n the text file in your\
          \ local computer/laptop. \n \n \n To execute the shell script file, type\
          \ source filename, then enter the password\nyou obtained earlier from NeCTAR\
          \ dashboard. \n Now, you are authenticated and please refer to\nrelevant\
          \ API document to see how to interact with the\nNeCTAR Cloud. \n EC2 API\
          \ \n There are 2 variables needed when using EC2 API clients: \n \n \n EC2_ACCESS_KEY:\
          \ username \n \n \n EC2_SECRET_KEY: password \n \n \n You can obtain these\
          \ 2 variables via the NeTCAR Dashboard: \n \n \n Go To Dashboard \n \n \n\

          \ copy and delete\ninstances. They have an operating system (you select\
          \ it from a list), network\naccess (a real IP address & you specify any\
          \ access), and hard disk storage.\nWith no hardware to maintain you can\
          \ copy (Snapshot) and customise new\nmachines rapidly. \n Tools \n The Nectar\
          \ Cloud Dashboard \n The Dashboard provides a web interface to get all the\
          \ basic\nResearch Cloud related jobs done. \n Use the dashboard: \n \n for\
          \ basic Cloud operations: (launching, duplicating & terminating ) instances\
          \ \n to get [Credentials] you can use with other [API clients] \n to make\
          \ an allocation request for a larger ongoing share of Research Cloud Resources.\
          \ \n \n More about instances \n If you are familiar with connecting to remote\
          \ machines already\nthe same tools and techniques apply when connecting\
          \ to running\ninstances. Your instance has a public IP address and, if\n\
          configured, can be reached and controlled with any remote\naccess tools\
          \ you wish to use. Example SSH. \n More information about launching and\
          \ managing instances is here \n Images \n Instances originate from Images\
          \ and can be a plain \"off the\nshelf\" Operating System or include software\
          \ packages and\nconfig changes to suit a particular purpose (eg Webserving).\n\
          There are publicly available images in the cloud ready for\nyou to use.\
          \ \n To suit your specific purposes an instance may need some\ncustomisation,\
          \ configuration changes or software installation.\nIts a good idea to make\
          \ a copy of the instance if you wish to\nre-use its current state as a starting\
          \ point for new instances.\nIf you are experimenting and making changes,\
          \ a copy allows you\nto return to the copied state and dispose of the experiment\n\
          without having to undo/redo configuration changes. \n You can create an\
          \ Image from scratch, but usually its easier\nto customise & copy a running\
          \ instance that is close\nto what you need. \n Copies of instances are called\
          \ Snapshots and can be used\nlike other Images to start new instances. Making\
          \ a Snapshot\nis simple: \n \n Go to the Dashboard \"Instances\" tab \n\
          \ Click \"Create Snapshot\" for the running instance you wish to copy. \n\
          \ \n Keypairs \n Key Pairs enable you to communicate with your instance\
          \ via\nSSH. When launching an instance you specify an existing key\npair.\
          \ The public key is injected into the running\ninstance's authorized_keys\
          \ file. \n You can manage your keypairs through the Dashboard or via\nthe\
          \ nova CLI client. \n In the dashboard under the Access & Security tab you\
          \ can\nmanage your keys. You have the option of: \n \n Importing an existing\
          \ SSH key you own \n Creating a new SSH Key \n \n Important: Keypairs can\
          \ only be specified on instance\ncreation, if you don't specify a keypair\
          \ on creation you will\nnot be able to add it later. \n Security groups\
          \ \n Incoming network access to your machines is usually required.\nSecurity\
          \ Groups are how to add network access. If you can't\nreach your instance\
          \ by SSH to login or by browser if it\nruns a Webserver additional Security\
          \ Group settings could be\nneeded. \n [Add link to more info] \n Storage\
          \ in the cloud \n The NeCTAR Research Cloud provides instances for research\n\
          use. While resources like processing cores, RAM and the\namount of storage\
          \ you get are dedicated to a particular\ninstance, other resources like\
          \ the network and the underlying\nstorage system are shared among instances.\
          \ Furthermore, not\nall storage is created equal, and Research Cloud users\n\
          have a few different types of storage available which differ\naccording\
          \ to performance, persistence and data safety. \n To find out which storage\
          \ option is right for you. We need\nto write the documentation for it. [LINK] "

          <h3>More about instances</h3>

          <p>If you are familiar with connecting to remote machines already

          the same tools and techniques apply when connecting to running

          instances. Your instance has a public IP address and, if

          configured, can be reached and controlled with any remote

          access tools you wish to use. Example SSH.</p>

          <p>More information about launching and managing instances is here</p>

          <h3>Images</h3>

          <p>Instances originate from Images and can be a plain "off the

          shelf" Operating System or include software packages and

          config changes to suit a particular purpose (eg Webserving).

          There are publicly available images in the cloud ready for

          you to use.</p>

          <p>To suit your specific purposes an instance may need some

          customisation, configuration changes or software installation.

          Its a good idea to make a copy of the instance if you wish to

          re-use its current state as a starting point for new instances.

          If you are experimenting and making changes, a copy allows you

          to return to the copied state and dispose of the experiment

          without having to undo/redo configuration changes.</p>

          <p>You can create an Image from scratch, but usually its easier

          to customise &amp; copy a running instance that is close

          to what you need.</p>

          <p>Copies of instances are called Snapshots and can be used

          like other Images to start new instances. Making a Snapshot

          is simple:</p>

          <ol>

          <li>Go to the Dashboard "Instances" tab</li>

          <li>Click "Create Snapshot" for the running instance you wish to copy.</li>

          </ol>

          <h2>Keypairs</h2>

          <p>Key Pairs enable you to communicate with your instance via

          SSH. When launching an instance you specify an existing key

          pair. The public key is injected into the running

          instance''s authorized_keys file.</p>

          <p>You can manage your keypairs through the Dashboard or via

          the nova CLI client.</p>

          <p>In the dashboard under the Access &amp; Security tab you can

          manage your keys. You have the option of:</p>

          <ul>

          <li>Importing an existing SSH key you own</li>

          <li>Creating a new SSH Key</li>

          </ul>

          <p><strong>Important:</strong> Keypairs can only be specified on instance

          creation, if you don''t specify a keypair on creation you will

          not be able to add it later.</p>

          <h2>Security groups</h2>

          <p>Incoming network access to your machines is usually required.

          Security Groups are how to add network access. If you can''t

          reach your instance by SSH to login or by browser if it

          runs a Webserver additional Security Group settings could be

          needed.</p>

          <p>[Add link to more info]</p>

          <h2>Storage in the cloud</h2>

          <p>The NeCTAR Research Cloud provides instances for research

          use. While resources like processing cores, RAM and the

          amount of storage you get are dedicated to a particular

          instance, other resources like the network and the underlying

          storage system are shared among instances. Furthermore, not

          all storage is created equal, and Research Cloud users

          have a few different types of storage available which differ

          according to performance, persistence and data safety.</p>

          <p>To find out which storage option is right for you. We need

          to write the documentation for it. [LINK]</p>'

    <h2>What is the Nectar Cloud</h2>

    <p><a href="http://nectar.org.au/">Nectar</a> (National eResearch Collaboration
    Tools and Resources) is an Australian Government project funded to build new infrastructure
    specifically for the needs of Australian researchers.  The Nectar Cloud provides
    supported computing infrastructure, giving researchers access to computing resources
    without the need to purchase or host their own hardware.<br>

    All Australian researchers have access to the Nectar Cloud via the <a href="http://support.rc.nectar.org.au/node/111">AAF</a>.</p>

    <p>To access the cloud all users must first login through the

    Nectar Cloud dashboard:

    <a href="https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au/">https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au/</a></p>

    <h2>Instances</h2>

    <p>Instances running inside the Research Cloud are just like real-life machines
    but

    in a remote location. The Research Cloud is used to start, copy and delete

    instances. They have an operating system (you select it from a list), network

    access (a real IP address &amp; you specify any access), and hard disk storage.

    With no hardware to maintain you can copy (Snapshot) and customise new

    machines rapidly.</p>

    <h2>Tools</h2>

    <h3>The Nectar Cloud Dashboard</h3>

    <p>The Dashboard provides a web interface to get all the basic

    Research Cloud related jobs done.</p>

    <p>Use the dashboard:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>for basic Cloud operations: (launching, duplicating &amp; terminating ) instances</li>

    <li>to get [Credentials] you can use with other [API clients]</li>

    <li>to make an allocation request for a larger ongoing share of Research Cloud
    Resources.</li>

    that other users can make use of the resources.</p>

    <p>Currently, there is no formal Nectar mechanism to discourage wasteful use of

    your allocation, but this is likely to change.</p>

    <h2>What should I do when I am finished with an instance</h2>

    <p>When you are finished with an Instance, you should terminate it.  Leaving an

    instance running, or in "paused" or "suspended" or "shutdown" states is tying

    down resources that other people could be using.</p>

    <p>Note that terminating an instance destroys its primary and ephemeral file

    systems.  If you want to save the primary file system (so that you can launch
    a

    new instance), snapshot the instance before you terminate it.</p>'

          \ persistence and data safety. \n On Virtual Machine Storage \n Each virtual\
          \ machine in the NeCTAR Cloud comes with a certain amount of built-in\n\
          storage and these storages are appeared as two separated hard disks\n(Root\
          \ Disk and Ephemeral Disk). These storage run off robust\nenterprise-grade\
          \ storage hardware on the back. However, both storage are not\nsuitable\
          \ for long-term persistent data as data will be lost after termination or\n\
          rebuilt of virtual machine. \n Root Disk \n This storage is used for operating\
          \ system of the virtual machine to boot it\ninto a functional state. It\
          \ has a limited 10GB in size, which is same for every\nstandard size of\
          \ virtual machine (Small, Medium, Large, Extra Large and\nExtra Extra Large).\
          \ The size various for non standard virtual machines such as\ntiny, which\
          \ only has 5GB root storage. \n Data stored on the root storage are persistent\
          \ until the termination or rebuilt\nof the virtual machine and are copied\
          \ during the snapshot. That means, if you\nreboot your virtual machine,\

          \ need to be taken as it should not be filled in full. The name of\nthis\
          \ disk as seen from the virtual machine is usually /dev/vda. \n Ephemeral\

          \ as you wish. It varies\nin size according to the size of virtual machine\
          \ (from 0GB to 480GB). For every\nCPU an standard virtual machine will get\
          \ 30GB of additional ephemeral storage.\nIt various in size for non-standard\
          \ virtual machine. The name of this device as\nseen from the instance is\
          \ usually /dev/vdb and some operating systems will\nautomatically format\
          \ and mount the ephemeral disk. For example, Ubuntu creates\nan ext3 partition\
          \ and mounts it at /mnt. For operating system don't do it\nautomatically,\
          \ you can format it by executing mkfs.ext4 /dev/vdb in command line\nand\
          \ mount it by executing mount /dev/vdb /mnt. You also need to have root\n\
          permission to do that. \n Data stored on ephemeral disk are only persistent\
          \ until the termination or\nrebuilt of virtual machine, which are same as\
          \ the root disk. The only difference\nis data on ephemeral disk are not\
          \ copied when taking an snapshot of virtual\nmachine, which means you cannot\
          \ use snapshot to save data stored on ephemeral\ndisk. \n Backup of Ephemeral\
          \ Disk \n Data on the ephemeral disk does not get saved in a snapshot, and\
          \ requires other\ntechniques to make a backup. Other forms of storage can\
          \ be used such as the\nObject Store and Volume Storage within the Research\
          \ Cloud or external locations. \n Persistent Volume Storage \n Persistent\
          \ volume storage can live outside your virtual machine. It is appears\n\
          as block storage which can be attached then accessed and even booted from.\
          \ This\nis a storage volume that you can attach to from within your virtual\
          \ machine,\nrea and write data, detach it, and make it available to another\
          \ virtual machine.\nYour data on a persistent volume is retained even when\
          \ you terminate your\nvirtual machine. Persistent Volumes offer a snapshot\
          \ feature which can be used\nto make convenient backups (uses some of your\
          \ overall Persistent Volume quota). \n NOTE: Persistent Volumes are local\
          \ services and only virtual machines in the\navailability zone where the\
          \ persistent Volume has been created can access it. \n How to Get Persistent\
          \ Volume Storage \n By default, there are no persistent volume storage available\
          \ to your project.\nYou need to make an allocation request to apply for\
          \ how many persistent volume\nstorage you want to have for your project.\
          \ Follow the below steps to make a\nrequest: \n \n \n Login to NeCTAR Cloud\
          \ Dashboard \n \n \n Go to Allocations and you can either click 'New Request'\
          \ to make a new request\n or 'My Requests' to amend an existing request\
          \ \n \n \n Under section 'Storage Quota', you select 'Resource' as volume,\
          \ select the\n Zone you want the storage to be and enter the GB in the 'Requested\
          \ Quota'. \n \n \n Click 'Submit' button \n \n \n Note:\nIt would take a\
          \ while before your request get approved. \n Create a persistent volume\
          \ storage \n Once your request has been approved, your project should have\
          \ volume storage\navailable. You need to create volume storage in NeCTAR\
          \ Cloud Dashboard first\nbefore you can use it. \n \n \n Login to NeCTAR\
          \ Cloud Dashboard \n \n \n Go to 'Volumes' \n \n \n Click 'Create Volume'\
          \ button \n \n \n Give a Volume Name and meaningful description \n \n \n\
          \ Select a volume source, this is how volume get built. You can select\n\
          \ 'No source empty volume' to create new empty volume. You can select 'image'\
          \ to\n build a volume from a image or 'Volume' to build a volume from existing\
          \ volume \n \n \n Give size to volume in GB \n \n \n Give a availability\
          \ zone \n \n \n Click 'Create Volume' button \n \n \n Attach a persistent\
          \ volume storage \n you can attach the volume created earlier to a running\
          \ virtual machine. See the\nbelow instruction: \n \n \n Login to NeCTAR\
          \ Cloud Dashboard \n \n \n Go to 'Volumes' \n \n \n Click the action list\

          \ \n Click 'Attach Volume' button \n \n \n Use Persistent Volume Storage\
          \ in Virtual Machine \n For a standard flavor virtual machine the persistent\
          \ volume will be attached\nas /dev/vdc. \n A new volume may not have a file\
          \ system (depending on how it was created) and\nyou need to create one before\
          \ mounting. \n The exact mount command syntax is dependent on the virtual\
          \ machine' operating\nsystem and the type of file system you require. \n\
          \ You can use below command to create file system on the new volume:\nsudo\
          \ mkfs.ext4 /dev/vdc \n WARNING: This can cause data loss if a file system\
          \ already exists on the target\nVolume. \n You can use below command to\
          \ mount the volume to /mnt\nsudo mount /dev/vdc /mnt -t auto \n Notes:\n\
          Volumes must be detached before deletion. \n Object Storage \n The NeCTAR\
          \ Cloud Object Storage is not a traditional file system, but rather a\n\
          distributed storage system for static data such as virtual machine images,\n\
          photo storage, email storage, backups and archives. Having no central \"\
          brain\" or\nmaster point of control provides greater scalability, redundancy\
          \ and durability.\nWhen you put a file in the NeCTAR Cloud Object Store,\
          \ 3 copies of your data are\ndistributed to different hardware for extra\
          \ data safety and performance. \n Think about that dataset comprised of\
          \ 2GB files that you read in and analyse\nmany times, but in general it\
          \ doesn't change. Or the images you want to use on\nthe cloud. Those are\
          \ a couple examples of what's perfect for Object Storage.\nObjects are written\
          \ to multiple hardware devices in the data center to ensure\nintegrity,\
          \ and great performance! \n In general, the object store is great for data\
          \ you write once and read many\ntimes, but not suitable for applications\
          \ like databases. It's the safest place\nto put your data on the NeCTAR\
          \ Research Cloud as multiple redundant copies of\nyour data are made, and\
          \ it has great performance. You can access the objec\nstore from anywhere\
          \ on the Internet, and data from Object Storage can be\ntransferred to and\
          \ from your virtual machine with a variety of http-capable\ntools. \n Object\
          \ Storage is completely decoupled from your virtual machine, so even if\
          \ you\nreboot, delete or crash your virtual machine, your Object Storage\
          \ files will\nremain safe (unless you remove them yourself). Object Storage\
          \ persists\nindependently from the life of an instance. \n Swift \n Swift\
          \ is the component that provides object storage for OpenStack. With your\n\
          credentials and via a URL you can request Swift to reserve & create storage\n\
          (called containers or buckets). Files (known as objects when stored in Swift)\n\
          can then be uploaded and accessed similarly by your running virtual machines.\
          \ \n The NeCTAR implementation of Swift is geodistributed across Nodes of\
          \ the NeCTAR\nCloud so that availability is not rely on any one data center\
          \ or network\ninfrastructure. Each collection of Swift nodes/hardware is\
          \ known as a region,\nwhich may or may not include a Swift proxy server\
          \ (the Internet facing and\nserving component of Swift). With some Swift\
          \ clients/APIs users can explicitly\nchose which proxy to connect to, this\
          \ might be useful e.g. for speeding up\nwrites to object storage by choosing\
          \ the nearest proxy. Due to NeCTAR's Swift\nhaving multiple regions (some\
          \ of which are Node private) some clients/APIs\nrequire explicit configuration\
          \ of a default region, which should be \"Melbourne\"\nfor most users. "

    \ hardware on the back. However, both storage are not\nsuitable for long-term\
    \ persistent data as data will be lost after termination or\nrebuilt of virtual\
    \ machine.</p>\n<h3>Root Disk</h3>\n<p>This storage is used for operating system\
    \ of the virtual machine to boot it\ninto a functional state. It has a limited\
    \ 10GB in size, which is same for every\nstandard size of virtual machine (Small,\
    \ Medium, Large, Extra Large and\nExtra Extra Large). The size various for non\
    \ standard virtual machines such as\ntiny, which only has 5GB root storage.</p>\n\
    <p>Data stored on the root storage are persistent until the termination or rebuilt\n\
    of the virtual machine and are copied during the snapshot. That means, if you\n\
    reboot your virtual machine, the data remains in tact and when you take a\npoint-in-time\
    \ snapshot of your virtual machine, the entire root storage is\ncopied. As the\
    \ root storage comes with fixed size and are used by the operation\nsystem, caution\
    \ need to be taken as it should not be filled in full. The name of\nthis disk\
    \ as seen from the virtual machine is usually /dev/vda.</p>\n<h3>Ephemeral Disk</h3>\n\
    <p>This storage appears as a second hard disk in your virtual machine and are\
    \ raw\nand unformatted block device, that you can format and use as you wish.\
    \ It varies\nin size according to the size of virtual machine (from 0GB to 480GB).\
    \ For every\nCPU an standard virtual machine will get 30GB of additional ephemeral\
    \ storage.\nIt various in size for non-standard virtual machine. The name of this\
    \ device as\nseen from the instance is usually /dev/vdb and some operating systems\
    \ will\nautomatically format and mount the ephemeral disk. For example, Ubuntu\
    \ creates\nan ext3 partition and mounts it at /mnt. For operating system don't\
    \ do it\nautomatically, you can format it by executing mkfs.ext4 /dev/vdb in command\
    \ line\nand mount it by executing mount /dev/vdb /mnt. You also need to have root\n\
    permission to do that.</p>\n<p>Data stored on ephemeral disk are only persistent\
    \ until the termination or\nrebuilt of virtual machine, which are same as the\
    \ root disk. The only difference\nis data on ephemeral disk are not copied when\
    \ taking an snapshot of virtual\nmachine, which means you cannot use snapshot\
    \ to save data stored on ephemeral\ndisk.</p>\n<h4>Backup of Ephemeral Disk</h4>\n\
    <p>Data on the ephemeral disk does not get saved in a snapshot, and requires other\n\
    techniques to make a backup. Other forms of storage can be used such as the\n\
    Object Store and Volume Storage within the Research Cloud or external locations.</p>\n\
    <h2>Persistent Volume Storage</h2>\n<p>Persistent volume storage can live outside\
    \ your virtual machine. It is appears\nas block storage which can be attached\
    \ then accessed and even booted from. This\nis a storage volume that you can attach\
    \ to from within your virtual machine,\nrea and write data, detach it, and make\
    \ it available to another virtual machine.\nYour data on a persistent volume is\
    \ retained even when you terminate your\nvirtual machine. Persistent Volumes offer\
    \ a snapshot feature which can be used\nto make convenient backups (uses some\
    \ of your overall Persistent Volume quota).</p>\n<p>NOTE: Persistent Volumes are\
    \ local services and only virtual machines in the\navailability zone where the\
    \ persistent Volume has been created can access it.</p>\n<h3>How to Get Persistent\
    \ Volume Storage</h3>\n<p>By default, there are no persistent volume storage available\
    \ to your project.\nYou need to make an allocation request to apply for how many\
    \ persistent volume\nstorage you want to have for your project. Follow the below\
    \ steps to make a\nrequest:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Login to NeCTAR Cloud <a href=\"\
    https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au\">Dashboard</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Go to\
    \ Allocations and you can either click 'New Request' to make a new request\n or\
    \ 'My Requests' to amend an existing request</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Under section\
    \ 'Storage Quota', you select 'Resource' as volume, select the\n Zone you want\
    \ the storage to be and enter the GB in the 'Requested Quota'.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\
    <p>Click 'Submit' button</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note:\nIt would take a while before\
    \ your request get approved.</p>\n<h3>Create a persistent volume storage</h3>\n\
    <p>Once your request has been approved, your project should have volume storage\n\
    available. You need to create volume storage in NeCTAR Cloud Dashboard first\n\
    before you can use it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Login to NeCTAR Cloud <a href=\"https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au\"\
    >Dashboard</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Go to 'Volumes'</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click\
    \ 'Create Volume' button</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Give a Volume Name and meaningful\
    \ description</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Select a volume source, this is how volume\
    \ get built. You can select\n 'No source empty volume' to create new empty volume.\
    \ You can select 'image' to\n build a volume from a image or 'Volume' to build\
    \ a volume from existing volume</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Give size to volume in GB</p>\n\
    </li>\n<li>\n<p>Give a availability zone</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click 'Create Volume'\
    \ button</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Attach a persistent volume storage</h3>\n<p>you\
    \ can attach the volume created earlier to a running virtual machine. See the\n\
    below instruction:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Login to NeCTAR Cloud <a href=\"https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au\"\
    >Dashboard</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Go to 'Volumes'</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click\
    \ the action list of volume</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click 'Edit Attachment'</p>\n\
    </li>\n<li>\n<p>Click 'Attach to Instance' drop down list to select a virtual\
    \ machine to\n attach a volume</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click 'Attach Volume' button</p>\n\
    </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Use Persistent Volume Storage in Virtual Machine</h3>\n<p>For\
    \ a standard flavor virtual machine the persistent volume will be attached\nas\
    \ /dev/vdc.</p>\n<p>A new volume may not have a file system (depending on how\
    \ it was created) and\nyou need to create one before mounting.</p>\n<p>The exact\
    \ mount command syntax is dependent on the virtual machine' operating\nsystem\
    \ and the type of file system you require.</p>\n<p>You can use below command to\
    \ create file system on the new volume:\nsudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/vdc</p>\n<p>WARNING:\
    \ This can cause data loss if a file system already exists on the target\nVolume.</p>\n\
    <p>You can use below command to mount the volume to /mnt\nsudo mount /dev/vdc\
    \ /mnt -t auto</p>\n<p>Notes:\nVolumes must be detached before deletion.</p>\n\
    <h2>Object Storage</h2>\n<p>The NeCTAR Cloud Object Storage is not a traditional\
    \ file system, but rather a\ndistributed storage system for static data such as\
    \ virtual machine images,\nphoto storage, email storage, backups and archives.\
    \ Having no central \"brain\" or\nmaster point of control provides greater scalability,\
    \ redundancy and durability.\nWhen you put a file in the NeCTAR Cloud Object Store,\
    \ 3 copies of your data are\ndistributed to different hardware for extra data\
    \ safety and performance.</p>\n<p>Think about that dataset comprised of 2GB files\
    \ that you read in and analyse\nmany times, but in general it doesn't change.\
    \ Or the images you want to use on\nthe cloud. Those are a couple examples of\
    \ what's perfect for Object Storage.\nObjects are written to multiple hardware\
    \ devices in the data center to ensure\nintegrity, and great performance!</p>\n\
    <p>In general, the object store is great for data you write once and read many\n\
    times, but not suitable for applications like databases. It's the safest place\n\
    to put your data on the NeCTAR Research Cloud as multiple redundant copies of\n\
    your data are made, and it has great performance. You can access the objec\nstore\
    \ from anywhere on the Internet, and data from Object Storage can be\ntransferred\
    \ to and from your virtual machine with a variety of http-capable\ntools.</p>\n\
    <p>Object Storage is completely decoupled from your virtual machine, so even if\
    \ you\nreboot, delete or crash your virtual machine, your Object Storage files\
    \ will\nremain safe (unless you remove them yourself). Object Storage persists\n\
    independently from the life of an instance.</p>\n<h3>Swift</h3>\n<p>Swift is the\
    \ component that provides object storage for OpenStack. With your\ncredentials\
    \ and via a URL you can request Swift to reserve &amp; create storage\n(called\
    \ containers or buckets). Files (known as objects when stored in Swift)\ncan then\
    \ be uploaded and accessed similarly by your running virtual machines.</p>\n<p>The\
    \ NeCTAR implementation of Swift is geodistributed across Nodes of the NeCTAR\n\
    Cloud so that availability is not rely on any one data center or network\ninfrastructure.\
    \ Each collection of Swift nodes/hardware is known as a region,\nwhich may or\
    \ may not include a Swift proxy server (the Internet facing and\nserving component\
    \ of Swift). With some Swift clients/APIs users can explicitly\nchose which proxy\
    \ to connect to, this might be useful e.g. for speeding up\nwrites to object storage\
    \ by choosing the nearest proxy. Due to NeCTAR's Swift\nhaving multiple regions\
    \ (some of which are Node private) some clients/APIs\nrequire explicit configuration\
    \ of a default region, which should be \"Melbourne\"\nfor most users.</p>"

        desc_un_html: " Security Recommendations \n This document lists a number of\
          \ Security Recommendations to help ensure the\nsafe running of your instances\
          \ on the cloud. Security is important, so please\nfollow these. We conduct\
          \ routine and random audits to determine the integrity\nof machine images\
          \ and running instances. If you have discovered a critical\nsecurity flaw,\
          \ or believe your machine has been compromised, please email\nsecurity@rc.nectar.org.au,\
          \ or for non-urgent security questions\nsupport@nectar.org.au. \n Mail Servers\
          \ \n If you run a mail server, make sure it only listens on the localhost\
          \ ip\naddress (127.0.0.1). For many clients, if you don't specify an SMTP\
          \ server\nwhen sending email, it will use the recipients SMTP server automatically.\
          \ This\nis probably what you want. Some nodes (Qld) disallow this and require\
          \ you to\nuse their SMTP server for outgoing mail. \n Enable Automatic Updates\
          \ \n All operating systems have the ability to apply updates automatically,\
          \ and its\neasy to turn this on. Please do so, and ask us if you need help.\
          \ \n Upgrade your kernel \n Some updates, such as a kernel upgrade require\
          \ a reboot of the instance. Please\nschedule this into your regular maintenance.\
          \ \n No open recursive name servers \n If you are running a DNS server,\
          \ please ensure you only allow recursion from\ntrusted hosts. \n Control\
          \ or disable access to your NTP server \n If you run an NTP server, limit\
          \ which systems can access it. Disable the\n'monlist' command as this can\
          \ be used as a denial of service vector on your\nsystem. For info about\
          \ DDoS by NTP, see\nthis article on Cloudflare \n Subscribe to security\
          \ announcements for your OS \n If there is a security problem with your\
          \ Operating System, you need to find\nout as soon as possible. Find the\
          \ appropriate mailing list and keep an eye\nout for anything that requires\
          \ urgent action. \n Run a restrictive firewall \n Your instances should\
          \ be configured so they allow the minimum access required\nto run their\
          \ service. Please use a host-based firewall, in conjunction with\nthe cloud-provided\
          \ firewall to manage access. \n Disable/Remove unneeded accounts \n Keep\
          \ an eye on the user accounts enabled on your system. Some applications\n\
          create default accounts which are insecure. \n Disable SSH password login\
          \ - use keys \n With enough time and compute power it is possible for passwords\
          \ to be brute\nforce attacked. The average SSH server deals with thousands\
          \ of such attacks\nevery week, so use ssh keys. Ubuntu provides some good\
          \ documentation \n Don't store keys on the image \n The cloud provides a\
          \ metadata service so you can download keys on boot, so\nyou don't need\
          \ to copy keys manually. This ensures that if your key is\ncompromised,\
          \ not all running instances of that image are compromised. \n Install ssh\
          \ attack banning tools \n Install a tools like fail2ban or denyhosts, which\
          \ checks log files for\nattempted breaches and then blocks malicious IP\

          <p>This document lists a number of Security Recommendations to help ensure
          the

          safe running of your instances on the cloud. Security is important, so please

          follow these. We conduct routine and random audits to determine the integrity

          of machine images and running instances. If you have discovered a critical

          security flaw, or believe your machine has been compromised, please email

          <a href="mailto:security@rc.nectar.org.au">security@rc.nectar.org.au</a>,
          or for non-urgent security questions

          <a href="mailto:support@nectar.org.au">support@nectar.org.au</a>.</p>

          <h2>Mail Servers</h2>

          <p>If you run a mail server, make sure it only listens on the localhost
          ip

          address (127.0.0.1). For many clients, if you don''t specify an SMTP server

          when sending email, it will use the recipients SMTP server automatically.
          This

          is probably what you want. Some nodes (Qld) disallow this and require you
          to

          use their SMTP server for outgoing mail.</p>

          <h2>Enable Automatic Updates</h2>

          <p>All operating systems have the ability to apply updates automatically,
          and its

          easy to turn this on. Please do so, and ask us if you need help.</p>

          <h2>Upgrade your kernel</h2>

          <p>Some updates, such as a kernel upgrade require a reboot of the instance.
          Please

          schedule this into your regular maintenance.</p>

          <h2>No open recursive name servers</h2>

          <p>If you are running a DNS server, please ensure you only allow recursion
          from

          trusted hosts.</p>

          <h2>Control or disable access to your NTP server</h2>

          <p>If you run an NTP server, limit which systems can access it. Disable
          the

          ''monlist'' command as this can be used as a denial of service vector on
          your

          system. For info about DDoS by NTP, see

          <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/understanding-and-mitigating-ntp-based-ddos-attacks/"
          title="Cloudflare Understanding NTP DDoS">this article on Cloudflare</a></p>

          <h2>Subscribe to security announcements for your OS</h2>

          <p>If there is a security problem with your Operating System, you need to
          find

          out as soon as possible. Find the appropriate mailing list and keep an eye

          out for anything that requires urgent action.</p>

          <h2>Run a restrictive firewall</h2>

          <p>Your instances should be configured so they allow the minimum access
          required

          to run their service. Please use a host-based firewall, in conjunction with

          the cloud-provided firewall to manage access.</p>

          <h2>Disable/Remove unneeded accounts</h2>

          <p>Keep an eye on the user accounts enabled on your system. Some applications

          create default accounts which are insecure.</p>

          <h2>Disable SSH password login - use keys</h2>

          <p>With enough time and compute power it is possible for passwords to be
          brute

          force attacked. The average SSH server deals with thousands of such attacks

          every week, so use ssh keys. Ubuntu provides some good documentation</p>

          <h2>Don''t store keys on the image</h2>

          <p>The cloud provides a metadata service so you can download keys on boot,
          so

          you don''t need to copy keys manually. This ensures that if your key is

          compromised, not all running instances of that image are compromised.</p>

          <h2>Install ssh attack banning tools</h2>

          <p>Install a tools like fail2ban or denyhosts, which checks log files for

          attempted breaches and then blocks malicious IP addresses.</p>

          <h2>Disable unneeded services</h2>

          <p>Know what services run on your image, and disable the unneeded ones before

          you upload it. This reduces the attack surface.</p>

          <h2>Use Encrypted Communications</h2>

          <p>Wherever possible, use encrypted communications to avoid attacks which

          intercept data.</p>

          <h2>Use best-practices for logging</h2>

          <p>Make sure that services are logging to a secure location, that is as

          tamperproof as possible. If logging remotely, ensure that it is done over

          a secure channel so that eavesdroppers cannot monitor what is happening
          on

          your instance.</p>'

        desc_un_html: " Storage \n This section describes more advanced topics about\
          \ storage available for Virtual\nMachines in NecTAR Cloud. \n Ephemeral\
          \ storage \n Each virtual Machine you start on the NeCTAR cloud comes with\
          \ a certain amount\nof on-instance storage based on the flavour of your\
          \ Virtual Machine, which\nappear as two separate hard disks. \n Note: On\
          \ instance storage is reguarded as ephemeral, you should treat it as\nscratch\
          \ space and keep important data in either Volume or Object storage. \n Primary\
          \ Disk (10GB) \n Every Instance has a 10GB primary disk which is used for\
          \ the image you launch.\nThe Primary disk is copied in a snapshot, so anything\
          \ on this primary disk can\nbe backed up via snapshots. \n The name of this\
          \ device as seen from the instance is usually /dev/vda. \n The size of primary\
          \ disk can be vary for non-standard flavour Virtual Machines. \n Secondary\
          \ Disk, 30GB to 480GB \n This appears as a second hard disk in your Virtual\
          \ Machine, that you can format\nand use as you wish. For every CPU an instance\
          \ will get 30GB of additional\nsecondary storage. \n The size of secondary\
          \ disk can be vary for non-standard flavour Virtual\nMachines. \n Note:\
          \ The secondary disk is not copied or backed up via snapshots. \n The name\
          \ of this device as seen from the instance is usually /dev/vdb and some\n\
          Operating Systems will automatically format and mount the secondary disk.\
          \ \n For example, Ubuntu creates an ext3 partition and mounts it at /mnt\
          \ \n you can also format it directly, by executing: \n mkfs.ext4 /dev/vdb\
          \ \n Then you can mount to any directory you like, by executing:\nmount\
          \ /dev/vdb /mount point \n Backup of Secondary or Ephemeral drivers \n Data\
          \ on the secondary drive does not get saved in a snapshot, and requires\
          \ other\nstorage and techniques to make a backup. For example, rsync \n\
          \ Volume Storage \n Persistent volume storage can live outside your Virtual\
          \ Machine. It is appears\nas block storage which can be attached then accessed\
          \ and even booted from.\nThis is a storage volume that you can attach to\
          \ from within your Virtual Machine,\nread and write data, detach it, and\
          \ make it available to another Virtual Machine\n(in same availability zone).\
          \ Your data on a persistent volume is retained even\nwhen you terminate\
          \ your instance. Persistent Volumes offer a snapshot feature\nwhich can\
          \ be used to make convenient backups\n(uses some of your overall volume\
          \ quota). \n Volume storage are local services and only Virtual Machines\
          \ in the same\navailability zone can access it. \n The below guide shows\
          \ how to use a volume storage via command line are are more\nfor advanced\
          \ users. For a basic introduction and instruction for DashBoard,\nplease\
          \ refer to the storage introduction article in the Cloud Basic section.\
          \ \n There are API clients you can use for management of volumes: \n \n\
          \ \n The OpenStack python-cinderclient has a wide range of commands\n to\
          \ work with volume storage (create, delete, snapshot) \n \n \n The OpenStack\
          \ python-novaclient to attach and detach volumes to\n instances \n \n \n\
          \ Please refer to the relevant document for how to install the\nabove API\
          \ clients. \n Before you can use the python-cinderclient and python-novaclient\
          \ you need to be\nauthenticated to the NeCTAR cloud. The below shows the\
          \ instructions of how to\nget username/password and authenticated. \n \n\
          \ \n Login to NeCTAR Cloud Dashboard \n \n \n Click 'Access & Security'\
          \ \n \n \n On the 'Access & Security' page, click tab 'API Access' \n \n\
          \ \n Click button \"Download OpenStack RC File\" \n \n \n Save the file\
          \ into a directory \n \n \n Click the drop down list with your email on\
          \ the right top of page, then click\n Settings \n \n \n Click 'Reset Password'\
          \ and save the password appeared on the screen \n \n \n API normally requires\
          \ 4 variables to be set for authentication: \n \n auth URL \n username \n\
          \ project id or name (most clients can handle either) \n password \n \n\
          \ When using the script file you downloaded from NeCTAR Dashboard, these\n\
          varilabels are set by the script file and you can see these variables\n\
          if you open the file. Example: \n OS_AUTH_URL: https://keystone.rc.nectar.org.au:5000/v2.0/\n\
          OS_TENANT_NAME=my_science_project\nOS_TENANT_ID=sdfsdfsfwrwewer\nOS_USERNAME=clouduser@example.edu.au\n\
          OS_PASSWORD=XXXXXX \n The below instruction assumes you use Linux operating\
          \ system. \n Once you have obtained the authentication script and password,\
          \ you can execute\nthe script suing source file-name.sh. and type in the\
          \ password you\nobtained from Dashboard. \n Nova API Client \n To List volumes,\
          \ execute nova volume-list \n To View details of a volume, execute nova\
          \ volume-show volume-id, you\nneed to replace the volume-id with the id\
          \ you obtained from nova volume-list \n To Create volume, execute \n nova\
          \ volume-create --display-name name--display-description description size\
          \ \n Arguments:\ndisplay-name: volume name\ndisplay-description volume description\n\
          size: volume size in GB \n To Delete volume, execute\nnova volume-delete\
          \ <volume> \n Positional arguments:\n: Name or ID of the volume to delete\
          \ \n To Attach volume to a Virtual Machine, use command: \n nova volume-attach\
          \ <server> <volume> [<device>] \n Positional arguments: \n \n \n server:\
          \  Name or ID of server \n \n \n volume:  ID of the volume to attach \n\
          \ \n \n device:  Name of the device e.g. /dev/vdb. Use auto for auto assign\
          \ \n \n \n OpenStack currently ignores the specified device when attaching\
          \ volumes, you can\nspecify 'auto' to let OpenStack to decide.\nOpenStack\
          \ adds the volume as the lowest available device name: \n For a standard\
          \ flavor Virtual Machine (with a primary & secondary drive) the\nfirst volume\
          \ will be attached as /dev/vdc. \n You can always execute nova to see what\
          \ volume command available and\nexecute nova help volume command for help\
          \ of the specific volume\ncommand. \n Cinder API Client \n Cinder is an\
          \ OpenStack project to provide \"block storage as a service\" \n To List\
          \ volumes, execute cinder list \n To Show details of a volume, execute cinder\
          \ show <volume> \n Positional arguments: \n \n volume:  Name or ID of the\
          \ volume. \n \n To Create volume, execute\ncinder create --display-name\
          \ name --display-description description size \n Positional arguments: \n\
          \ \n \n display-name: volume name \n \n \n display-description volume description\
          \ \n \n \n size: volume size in GB \n \n \n You can also create a volume\
          \ based on an existing volume or image by adding the\nthe following 2 arguments\
          \ to cinder create command: \n --source-volid : Create volume from volume\
          \ id (Optional, Default=None) \n --image-id  Create volume from image id\
          \ (Optional, Default=None) \n To Delete volume, execute \n cinder delete\
          \ <volume> \n Positional arguments: \n \n volume: Name or ID of the volume\
          \ to delete \n \n To Rename volume, execute\ncinder rename <volume> [<display-name>]\
          \ \n Positional arguments: \n \n \n volume: Name or ID of the volume to\
          \ rename. \n \n \n display-name: New display-name for the volume. \n \n\
          \ \n Cinder also provides other volume related commands such as backup,\
          \ snapshot and\nvolume type. \n You can always execute cinder to see what\
          \ volume command available and\nexecute cinder help command for help of\
          \ the specific volume command. \n Notes:\nThere are more API clients avaible\
          \ to manage the Volument Storage, please refer\nto the releanve documents\
          \ or search through Internet. \n Client Python API \n Rather than running\
          \ the client API in command line, Client API can also be used\nwithin the\
          \ Python code. \n The nova and cinder Python API client can be installed\
          \ easily by using pip\ncommand. Please refer to the relevant document for\
          \ installation of pip. \n The below shows a sample python code of using\
          \ Nova Python API: \n from novaclient import client\nnova = client.Client(VERSION,\
          \ USERNAME, PASSWORD, PROJECT_NAME, AUTH_URL)\nnova.volumes.create(parameters)\n\
          nova.volumes.delete(parameters)\nnova.volumes.create_server_volume(parameters)\
          \ \n The VERSION parameter can be \"1.1\" or \"2\" \n create method is used\
          \ to create a new volume and it takes below parameters: \n \n \n size: \
          \ Size of volume in GB \n \n \n snapshot_id:  ID of the snapshot \n \n \n\
          \ display_name  Name of the volume \n \n \n display_description  Description\
          \ of the volume \n \n \n volume_type  Type of volume \n \n \n availability_zone\
          \  Availability Zone for volume \n \n \n imageRef  reference to an image\
          \ stored in glance \n \n \n Return type:\nVolume \n delete method is used\
          \ to delete a volume and it takes below arguments: \n \n volumen: The Volume\
          \ to delete \n \n create_server_volume is used to attach a volume to a Virtual\
          \ Machine and takes\nbelow arguments: \n \n \n server_id: The ID of the\
          \ server \n \n \n volume_id: The ID of the volume to attach \n \n \n device:\
          \ the device name \n \n \n To get username, password and other information,\
          \ you can refer back the\nauthentication script obtained from NeCTAR Cloud\
          \ Dashboard. \n To see more information please refer to Nova Python API\
          \ \n The below shows a sample python code of using Cinder Python API: \n\
          \ from cinderclient import client\ncinder = client.Client(VERSION, USERNAME,\
          \ PASSWORD, PROJECT_NAME, AUTH_URL)\ncinder.volumes.list()\ncinder.attach(parameters)\n\
          cinder.get(parameters) \n list method is used to list all volumes in the\
          \ project \n attach method is used to attach volume to an Virtual Machine\
          \ and it takes below\nparameters: \n \n \n volume: The :class:Volume (or\
          \ its ID) you would like to attach. \n \n \n instance_uuid: uuid of the\
          \ attaching instance. \n \n \n mountpoint: mountpoint on the attaching instance.\
          \ \n \n \n mode: the access mode. \n \n \n get method is to get details\
          \ of a volume and it takes below parameters: \n \n volume_id: The ID of\
          \ the volume to get \n \n To see more information and commands please refer\
          \ to\nCinder Python API \n Boot from Volume \n You can use the below command\
          \ to boot from volume: \n nova boot --flavor m1.small --key_name <mykey>\
          \ --block_device_mapping vda=<volume-id>:::0 <instance_name> \n Note:\n\
          Changing the '0' to '1' changes the delete_on_terminate option to delete\
          \ the\nvolume on instance termination \n Use Volume within Virtual Machine\
          \ \n A new Volume may not have a filesystem (depending on how it was created)\
          \ and you\nneed to create one before mounting. \n The exact mount command\
          \ syntax is dependent on the Virtual Machines' operating\nsystem and the\
          \ type of filesystem you require. \n You can use the below command to create\
          \ ext4 file system and assumes volume is\non vdc: \n sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/vdc\
          \ \n Warning: creating new file system can cause data loss if a filesystem\
          \ already\nexists on the target volume. \n The exact mount command syntax\
          \ is dependent on the Virtual Machine' Operating\nSystem, so the advice\
          \ can only be generic. eg \n sudo mount /dev/vdc /mnt -t auto \n This will\
          \ mount the disk if the type of file-system can be guessed, otherwise\n\
          you may have to specify \"-t file-system-type\". \n If you did not create\
          \ and format the Volume then you might work out the\nfile-system type by\
          \ executing the below command: \n sudo parted -l \n Finally if you want\
          \ the filesystem auto-mounted at boot consider changing the\n\"/etc/fstab\"\
          \ (or equivalent for your OS) which specifies devices and mountpoints\n\
          and whether to mount them automatically or just be aware they exist and\
          \ allow\nsimplified mounting sytax such as: \n mount  /mnt\nor\nmount /device\
          \ \n Object Storage \n Object Storage is not a traditional file-system or\
          \ real-time data storage system.\nIt's designed for mostly static data that\
          \ can be retrieved, leveraged, and then\nupdated if necessary. It is independant\
          \ of a particular Virtual Machine and can\nbe updated and used without having\
          \ any Virtual Machine running. It is designed\nto be redundant and scalable.\
          \ \n Concept \n Think about that dataset comprised of 2GB files that you\
          \ read in and analyse\nmany times, but in general it doesn't change. Or\
          \ the images you want to use on\nthe cloud. Those are a couple examples\
          \ of what's perfect for Object Storage.\nObjects are written to multiple\
          \ hardware devices in the data cente to ensure\nintegrity, and great performance!\
          \ \n In general, the object store is great for data you write once and read\
          \ many\ntimes, but not suitable for applications like databases. It's the\
          \ safest place\nto put your data on the NeCTAR Research Cloud as multiple\
          \ redundant copies of\nyour data are made, and it has great performance.\
          \ You can access the object\nstore from anywhere on the Internet, and data\
          \ from Object Storage can be\ntransferred to and from your Virtual Machine\
          \ with a variety of http-capable\ntools. \n Swift \n Swift is the component\
          \ that provides object storage for OpenStack. With your\ncredentials and\
          \ via a URL you can request Swift to reserve & create storage\n(called containers\
          \ or buckets). Files (known as objects when stored in Swift)\ncan then be\
          \ uploaded and accessed similarly by your running Virtual Machines. \n The\
          \ NeCTAR implementation of Swift is geodistributed across Nodes of the\n\
          Research Cloud so that availability is not reliant on any one datacentre\
          \ or\nnetwork infrastructure. Each collection of Swift nodes/hardware is\
          \ known as a\nregion, which may or may not include a Swift proxy server\
          \ (the Internet facing\nand serving component of Swift). With some Swift\
          \ clients/APIs users can\nexplicitly chose which proxy to connect to, this\
          \ might be useful e.g. for\nspeeding up writes to object storage by choosing\
          \ the nearest proxy. Due to\nNeCTAR's Swift having multiple regions (some\
          \ of which are Node private) some\nclients/APIs require explicit configuration\
          \ of a default region, which should\nbe \"Melbourne\" for most users. \n\
          \ Swift does not provide encryption of the data it stores. If you have sensitive\n\
          data that requires encryption you must encrypt the data files before upload.\
          \ \n Swift Command Line Client \n The swift client is the command-line interface\
          \ (CLI) for the OpenStack Object\nAPI and its extensions. \n It is same\
          \ as nova client and cinder lcient, you need to authente before you can\n\
          use the it. Please refer the above instruction about how to get authenticated.\
          \ \n Please also refer above instruction for how to install the swift client.\
          \ \n To list all containers, execute: \n swift list \n To list all objects\
          \ under a container, execute: \n swift list [container] \n Positional arguments:\
          \ \n \n container: Name of container to list object in \n \n To create a\
          \ container, execute \n swift post [container] \n Positional arguments:\
          \ \n \n container: Name of container to create \n \n To delete a container\
          \ and a object within it, execute: \n swift delete [container][object] \n\
          \ Positional arguments:\ncontainer: Name of container to delete from\nobject:\
          \ Name of object ot delete. Specify multiple times for multiple objects\
          \ \n To upload files or directories to the given container, execute: \n\
          \ swift upload <container> <file_or_directory> \n Positional arguments:\
          \ \n \n \n container: Name of container to upload to \n \n \n file_or_directory:\
          \ Name of file or directory to uploaded. Specify multiple\n times for multiple\
          \ uploads \n \n \n To download objects from a given container, execute:\
          \ \n swift download <container> [object] \n Positional arguments: \n \n\
          \ \n container: Name of container to download from. To download a whole\
          \ account,\n omit this and specify --all \n \n \n object: Name of object\
          \ to download. Specify multiple times for multiple\n objects. Omit this\
          \ to download all objects from the container \n \n \n You can execute swift\
          \ to see what commands are avaiable and\nrun swift command -h find out more\
          \ information about a command. \n Client python API \n You can also use\
          \ swift python API to access and manage the object storage.\nThe below shows\
          \ the sample Pthon code: \n ```\nfrom swiftclient import client \n swift\
          \ = client.Connection(authurl=url, user=username, key=password,\ntenant_name=project_name,\
          \ auth_version='2') \n container_name=\"\"\nswift.get_container(container_name)\
          \ \n container_name=\"first container\"\nswift.put_container(container_name)\
          \ \n swift.delete_container(container_name) \n container_name = \"container\"\
          \nobject_name = \"object\"\nswift.get_object(container_name, object_name)\
          \ \n swift.put_object(container_name, object)\n``` \n Please refer to above\
          \ instruction about how to obtain authurl, user, password and\ntenant_name.\
          \ \n To get a container, use swift.get_container(container_name) method,\
          \ if you\nprovide a empty string to the container_name parameter, it returns\
          \ all\ncontainers in your project. \n To create a container, use swift.post_container(container_name)\
          \ method. \n To delete a container, use swift.delete_container(container_name)\
          \ method. \n To get a object, use swift.get_object(container_name, object_name)\
          \ method. \n To upload a object, use swift.put_object(container_name, object)\
          \ method. \n Please refer to the swift python cliet document for more\n\
          information. \n Storage Performance \n Storage performance is various based\
          \ on that the implementation of each node may\ntake different storage approach\
          \ and due to differences in hardware. For example: \n \n \n faster spindle\
          \ speeds \n \n \n SSD cache \n \n \n local storage on compute nodes \n \n\
          \ \n shared storage across compute nodes \n \n \n underline network infrastructure\
          \ \n \n \n The storage performance also depends largely on the choice of\
          \ file system and\nthe way how applications operates. \n The below tables\
          \ shows a comparison of various data storage features: \n\n\n\nStorage type\n\

          \ Block level device (like\nattaching a hard drive to a computer) or HTTP\
          \ where you use access data\nvia HTTP protocol.\nBack up means whehter there\
          \ is a recoverable copy of a file available after a\nfile is updated, deleted\

          \ some storage performance tuning can be\ndone inside the Virtual Machine.\
          \ \n \n Use the noop I/O scheduler if possibile. Other Virtual machine scheduler\n\
          \ conflicts with hypervisor scheduler. If the device boots with grub, this\
          \ can be\n added as the kernel command line option \n \n elevator=noop \n\
          \ \n Virtual Machine disk partitions should be correctly alligned to the\
          \ underlying\n filesystem, otherwise I/O performance will be degraded. A\
          \ quick way to check if\n your Virtual Machine's partition alligned is to\
          \ check with fdisk -lu.\n Each partition should start on sector divisible\
          \ by 8. \n \n After the performance tuning and you still have slow storage\
          \ access, you can\ncontact the NeCTAR help desk. "
        description: "<h1>Storage</h1>\n<p>This section describes more advanced topics\
          \ about storage available for Virtual\nMachines in NecTAR Cloud.</p>\n<h2>Ephemeral\
          \ storage</h2>\n<p>Each virtual Machine you start on the NeCTAR cloud comes\
          \ with a certain amount\nof on-instance storage based on the flavour of\
          \ your Virtual Machine, which\nappear as two separate hard disks.</p>\n\
          <p>Note: On instance storage is reguarded as ephemeral, you should treat\
          \ it as\nscratch space and keep important data in either Volume or Object\
          \ storage.</p>\n<h3>Primary Disk (10GB)</h3>\n<p>Every Instance has a 10GB\
          \ primary disk which is used for the image you launch.\nThe Primary disk\
          \ is copied in a snapshot, so anything on this primary disk can\nbe backed\
          \ up via snapshots.</p>\n<p>The name of this device as seen from the instance\
          \ is usually /dev/vda.</p>\n<p>The size of primary disk can be vary for\
          \ non-standard flavour Virtual Machines.</p>\n<h3>Secondary Disk, 30GB to\
          \ 480GB</h3>\n<p>This appears as a second hard disk in your Virtual Machine,\
          \ that you can format\nand use as you wish. For every CPU an instance will\
          \ get 30GB of additional\nsecondary storage.</p>\n<p>The size of secondary\
          \ disk can be vary for non-standard flavour Virtual\nMachines.</p>\n<p>Note:\
          \ The secondary disk is not copied or backed up via snapshots.</p>\n<p>The\
          \ name of this device as seen from the instance is usually /dev/vdb and\
          \ some\nOperating Systems will automatically format and mount the secondary\
          \ disk.</p>\n<p>For example, Ubuntu creates an ext3 partition and mounts\
          \ it at /mnt</p>\n<p>you can also format it directly, by executing:</p>\n\
          <p><code>mkfs.ext4 /dev/vdb</code></p>\n<p>Then you can mount to any directory\
          \ you like, by executing:\nmount /dev/vdb /mount point</p>\n<h3>Backup of\
          \ Secondary or Ephemeral drivers</h3>\n<p>Data on the secondary drive does\
          \ not get saved in a snapshot, and requires other\nstorage and techniques\
          \ to make a backup. For example, rsync</p>\n<h2>Volume Storage</h2>\n<p>Persistent\
          \ volume storage can live outside your Virtual Machine. It is appears\n\
          as block storage which can be attached then accessed and even booted from.\n\
          This is a storage volume that you can attach to from within your Virtual\
          \ Machine,\nread and write data, detach it, and make it available to another\
          \ Virtual Machine\n(in same availability zone). Your data on a persistent\
          \ volume is retained even\nwhen you terminate your instance. Persistent\
          \ Volumes offer a snapshot feature\nwhich can be used to make convenient\
          \ backups\n(uses some of your overall volume quota).</p>\n<p>Volume storage\
          \ are local services and only Virtual Machines in the same\navailability\
          \ zone can access it.</p>\n<p>The below guide shows how to use a volume\
          \ storage via command line are are more\nfor advanced users. For a basic\
          \ introduction and instruction for DashBoard,\nplease refer to the storage\
          \ introduction article in the Cloud Basic section.</p>\n<p>There are API\
          \ clients you can use for management of volumes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The\
          \ OpenStack <a href=\"http://docs.openstack.org/developer/python-novaclient/man/nova.html\"\
          >python-cinderclient</a> has a wide range of commands\n to work with volume\
          \ storage (create, delete, snapshot)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The OpenStack\
          \ <a href=\"http://docs.openstack.org/developer/python-novaclient/man/nova.html\"\
          >python-novaclient</a> to attach and detach volumes to\n instances</p>\n\
          </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please refer to the relevant <a href=\"http://docs.openstack.org/user-guide/common/cli_install_openstack_command_line_clients.html\"\
          >document</a> for how to install the\nabove API clients.</p>\n<p>Before\
          \ you can use the python-cinderclient and python-novaclient you need to\
          \ be\nauthenticated to the NeCTAR cloud. The below shows the instructions\
          \ of how to\nget username/password and authenticated.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n\
          <p>Login to NeCTAR Cloud <a href=\"https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au\"\
          >Dashboard</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click 'Access &amp; Security'</p>\n\
          </li>\n<li>\n<p>On the 'Access &amp; Security' page, click tab 'API Access'</p>\n\
          </li>\n<li>\n<p>Click button \"Download OpenStack RC File\"</p>\n</li>\n\
          <li>\n<p>Save the file into a directory</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click the drop\
          \ down list with your email on the right top of page, then click\n Settings</p>\n\
          </li>\n<li>\n<p>Click 'Reset Password' and save the password appeared on\
          \ the screen</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>API normally requires 4 variables to\
          \ be set for authentication:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>auth URL</li>\n<li>username</li>\n\
          <li>project id or name (most clients can handle either)</li>\n<li>password</li>\n\
          </ul>\n<p>When using the script file you downloaded from NeCTAR Dashboard,\
          \ these\nvarilabels are set by the script file and you can see these variables\n\
          if you open the file. Example:</p>\n<p>OS_AUTH_URL: https://keystone.rc.nectar.org.au:5000/v2.0/\n\
          OS_TENANT_NAME=my_science_project\nOS_TENANT_ID=sdfsdfsfwrwewer\nOS_USERNAME=clouduser@example.edu.au\n\
          OS_PASSWORD=XXXXXX</p>\n<p>The below instruction assumes you use Linux operating\
          \ system.</p>\n<p>Once you have obtained the authentication script and password,\
          \ you can execute\nthe script suing <code>source file-name.sh</code>. and\
          \ type in the password you\nobtained from Dashboard.</p>\n<h3>Nova API Client</h3>\n\
          <p>To List volumes, execute <code>nova volume-list</code></p>\n<p>To View\
          \ details of a volume, execute <code>nova volume-show volume-id</code>,\
          \ you\nneed to replace the volume-id with the id you obtained from nova\
          \ volume-list</p>\n<p>To Create volume, execute</p>\n<p><code>nova volume-create\
          \ --display-name name--display-description description size</code></p>\n\
          <p>Arguments:\ndisplay-name: volume name\ndisplay-description volume description\n\
          size: volume size in GB</p>\n<p>To Delete volume, execute\n<code>nova volume-delete\
          \ &lt;volume&gt;</code></p>\n<p>Positional arguments:\n: Name or ID of the\
          \ volume to delete</p>\n<p>To Attach volume to a Virtual Machine, use command:</p>\n\
          <p><code>nova volume-attach &lt;server&gt; &lt;volume&gt; [&lt;device&gt;]</code></p>\n\
          <p>Positional arguments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>server:  Name or ID of server</p>\n\
          </li>\n<li>\n<p>volume:  ID of the volume to attach</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>device:\
          \  Name of the device e.g. /dev/vdb. Use auto for auto assign</p>\n</li>\n\
          </ul>\n<p>OpenStack currently ignores the specified device when attaching\
          \ volumes, you can\nspecify 'auto' to let OpenStack to decide.\nOpenStack\
          \ adds the volume as the lowest available device name:</p>\n<p>For a standard\
          \ flavor Virtual Machine (with a primary &amp; secondary drive) the\nfirst\
          \ volume will be attached as /dev/vdc.</p>\n<p>You can always execute <code>nova</code>\
          \ to see what volume command available and\nexecute <code>nova help volume\
          \ command</code> for help of the specific volume\ncommand.</p>\n<h3>Cinder\
          \ API Client</h3>\n<p>Cinder is an OpenStack project to provide \"block\
          \ storage as a service\"</p>\n<p>To List volumes, execute <code>cinder list</code></p>\n\
          <p>To Show details of a volume, execute <code>cinder show &lt;volume&gt;</code></p>\n\
          <p>Positional arguments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>volume:  Name or ID of the volume.</li>\n\
          </ul>\n<p>To Create volume, execute\n<code>cinder create --display-name\
          \ name --display-description description size</code></p>\n<p>Positional\
          \ arguments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>display-name: volume name</p>\n</li>\n\
          <li>\n<p>display-description volume description</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>size:\
          \ volume size in GB</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can also create a volume based\
          \ on an existing volume or image by adding the\nthe following 2 arguments\
          \ to cinder create command:</p>\n<p>--source-volid : Create volume from\
          \ volume id (Optional, Default=None)</p>\n<p>--image-id  Create volume from\
          \ image id (Optional, Default=None)</p>\n<p>To Delete volume, execute</p>\n\
          <p><code>cinder delete &lt;volume&gt;</code></p>\n<p>Positional arguments:</p>\n\
          <ul>\n<li>volume: Name or ID of the volume to delete</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To\
          \ Rename volume, execute\n<code>cinder rename &lt;volume&gt; [&lt;display-name&gt;]</code></p>\n\
          <p>Positional arguments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>volume: Name or ID of the volume\
          \ to rename.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>display-name: New display-name for the\
          \ volume.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cinder also provides other volume related\
          \ commands such as backup, snapshot and\nvolume type.</p>\n<p>You can always\
          \ execute <code>cinder</code> to see what volume command available and\n\
          execute <code>cinder help command</code> for help of the specific volume\
          \ command.</p>\n<p>Notes:\nThere are more API clients avaible to manage\
          \ the Volument Storage, please refer\nto the releanve documents or search\
          \ through Internet.</p>\n<h3>Client Python API</h3>\n<p>Rather than running\
          \ the client API in command line, Client API can also be used\nwithin the\
          \ Python code.</p>\n<p>The nova and cinder Python API client can be installed\
          \ easily by using pip\ncommand. Please refer to the relevant <a href=\"\
          https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html\">document</a> for installation\
          \ of pip.</p>\n<p>The below shows a sample python code of using Nova Python\
          \ API:</p>\n<p><code>from novaclient import client\nnova = client.Client(VERSION,\
          \ USERNAME, PASSWORD, PROJECT_NAME, AUTH_URL)\nnova.volumes.create(parameters)\n\

          http://docs.openstack.org/developer/python-cinderclient/\">Cinder Python\
          \ API</a></p>\n<h3>Boot from Volume</h3>\n<p>You can use the below command\
          \ to boot from volume:</p>\n<p><code>nova boot --flavor m1.small --key_name\
          \ &lt;mykey&gt; --block_device_mapping vda=&lt;volume-id&gt;:::0 &lt;instance_name&gt;</code></p>\n\
          <p>Note:\nChanging the '0' to '1' changes the delete_on_terminate option\
          \ to delete the\nvolume on instance termination</p>\n<h3>Use Volume within\
          \ Virtual Machine</h3>\n<p>A new Volume may not have a filesystem (depending\
          \ on how it was created) and you\nneed to create one before mounting.</p>\n\
          <p>The exact mount command syntax is dependent on the Virtual Machines'\
          \ operating\nsystem and the type of filesystem you require.</p>\n<p>You\
          \ can use the below command to create ext4 file system and assumes volume\
          \ is\non vdc:</p>\n<p><code>sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/vdc</code></p>\n<p>Warning:\
          \ creating new file system can cause data loss if a filesystem already\n\
          exists on the target volume.</p>\n<p>The exact mount command syntax is dependent\
          \ on the Virtual Machine' Operating\nSystem, so the advice can only be generic.\
          \ eg</p>\n<p><code>sudo mount /dev/vdc /mnt -t auto</code></p>\n<p>This\
          \ will mount the disk if the type of file-system can be guessed, otherwise\n\
          you may have to specify \"-t file-system-type\".</p>\n<p>If you did not\
          \ create and format the Volume then you might work out the\nfile-system\
          \ type by executing the below command:</p>\n<p><code>sudo parted -l</code></p>\n\
          <p>Finally if you want the filesystem auto-mounted at boot consider changing\
          \ the\n\"/etc/fstab\" (or equivalent for your OS) which specifies devices\
          \ and mountpoints\nand whether to mount them automatically or just be aware\
          \ they exist and allow\nsimplified mounting sytax such as:</p>\n<p><code>mount\
          \  /mnt\nor\nmount /device</code></p>\n<h2>Object Storage</h2>\n<p>Object\
          \ Storage is not a traditional file-system or real-time data storage system.\n\
          It's designed for mostly static data that can be retrieved, leveraged, and\
          \ then\nupdated if necessary. It is independant of a particular Virtual\
          \ Machine and can\nbe updated and used without having any Virtual Machine\
          \ running. It is designed\nto be redundant and scalable.</p>\n<h3>Concept</h3>\n\
          <p>Think about that dataset comprised of 2GB files that you read in and\
          \ analyse\nmany times, but in general it doesn't change. Or the images you\
          \ want to use on\nthe cloud. Those are a couple examples of what's perfect\
          \ for Object Storage.\nObjects are written to multiple hardware devices\
          \ in the data cente to ensure\nintegrity, and great performance!</p>\n<p>In\
          \ general, the object store is great for data you write once and read many\n\
          times, but not suitable for applications like databases. It's the safest\
          \ place\nto put your data on the NeCTAR Research Cloud as multiple redundant\
          \ copies of\nyour data are made, and it has great performance. You can access\
          \ the object\nstore from anywhere on the Internet, and data from Object\
          \ Storage can be\ntransferred to and from your Virtual Machine with a variety\
          \ of http-capable\ntools.</p>\n<h3>Swift</h3>\n<p>Swift is the component\
          \ that provides object storage for OpenStack. With your\ncredentials and\
          \ via a URL you can request Swift to reserve &amp; create storage\n(called\
          \ containers or buckets). Files (known as objects when stored in Swift)\n\
          can then be uploaded and accessed similarly by your running Virtual Machines.</p>\n\
          <p>The NeCTAR implementation of Swift is geodistributed across Nodes of\
          \ the\nResearch Cloud so that availability is not reliant on any one datacentre\
          \ or\nnetwork infrastructure. Each collection of Swift nodes/hardware is\
          \ known as a\nregion, which may or may not include a Swift proxy server\
          \ (the Internet facing\nand serving component of Swift). With some Swift\
          \ clients/APIs users can\nexplicitly chose which proxy to connect to, this\
          \ might be useful e.g. for\nspeeding up writes to object storage by choosing\
          \ the nearest proxy. Due to\nNeCTAR's Swift having multiple regions (some\
          \ of which are Node private) some\nclients/APIs require explicit configuration\
          \ of a default region, which should\nbe \"Melbourne\" for most users.</p>\n\
          <p>Swift does not provide encryption of the data it stores. If you have\
          \ sensitive\ndata that requires encryption you must encrypt the data files\
          \ before upload.</p>\n<h3>Swift Command Line Client</h3>\n<p>The swift client\
          \ is the command-line interface (CLI) for the OpenStack Object\nAPI and\
          \ its extensions.</p>\n<p>It is same as nova client and cinder lcient, you\
          \ need to authente before you can\nuse the it. Please refer the above instruction\
          \ about how to get authenticated.</p>\n<p>Please also refer above instruction\
          \ for how to install the swift client.</p>\n<p>To list all containers, execute:</p>\n\
          <p><code>swift list</code></p>\n<p>To list all objects under a container,\
          \ execute:</p>\n<p><code>swift list [container]</code></p>\n<p>Positional\
          \ arguments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>container: Name of container to list object\

          <p>swift.delete_container(container_name)</p>\n<p>container_name = \"container\"\
          \nobject_name = \"object\"\nswift.get_object(container_name, object_name)</p>\n\
          <p>swift.put_object(container_name, object)\n```</p>\n<p>Please refer to\
          \ above instruction about how to obtain authurl, user, password and\ntenant_name.</p>\n\
          <p>To get a container, use swift.get_container(container_name) method, if\
          \ you\nprovide a empty string to the container_name parameter, it returns\
          \ all\ncontainers in your project.</p>\n<p>To create a container, use swift.post_container(container_name)\
          \ method.</p>\n<p>To delete a container, use swift.delete_container(container_name)\
          \ method.</p>\n<p>To get a object, use swift.get_object(container_name,\
          \ object_name) method.</p>\n<p>To upload a object, use swift.put_object(container_name,\
          \ object) method.</p>\n<p>Please refer to the <a href=\"http://docs.openstack.org/developer/python-swiftclient/index.html\"\
          >swift python cliet document</a> for more\ninformation.</p>\n<h2>Storage\
          \ Performance</h2>\n<p>Storage performance is various based on that the\
          \ implementation of each node may\ntake different storage approach and due\
          \ to differences in hardware. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>faster spindle\
          \ speeds</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>SSD cache</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>local storage\
          \ on compute nodes</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>shared storage across compute nodes</p>\n\
          </li>\n<li>\n<p>underline network infrastructure</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The\
          \ storage performance also depends largely on the choice of file system\
          \ and\nthe way how applications operates.</p>\n<p>The below tables shows\
          \ a comparison of various data storage features:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n\
          <tr>\n<th>Storage type</th>\n<th>Saved in snapshot</th>\n<th>Data integrity</th>\n\
          <th>Access</th>\n<th>Back up</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>On-instance\
          \ Primary Disk</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>Ok</td>\n<td>Block</td>\n<td>No</td>\n\
          </tr>\n<tr>\n<td>On-instance Secondary Disk</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>Ok</td>\n\
          <td>Block</td>\n<td>No</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Volumes</td>\n<td>No</td>\n\
          <td>Good</td>\n<td>Block</td>\n<td>No</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Object Storage</td>\n\
          <td>No</td>\n<td>Best</td>\n<td>HTTP</td>\n<td>No</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n\
          </table>\n<p>Notes:\nData Integrity means how your data exposed to hardware\
          \ errors.\nAccess means how storage gets access through eith Block level\
          \ device (like\nattaching a hard drive to a computer) or HTTP where you\
          \ use access data\nvia HTTP protocol.\nBack up means whehter there is a\
          \ recoverable copy of a file available after a\nfile is updated, deleted\
          \ or damaged.</p>\n<h3>Performance Tuning</h3>\n<p>If you experience slow\
          \ storage access, some storage performance tuning can be\ndone inside the\
          \ Virtual Machine.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use the noop I/O scheduler if possibile.\
          \ Other Virtual machine scheduler\n conflicts with hypervisor scheduler.\
          \ If the device boots with grub, this can be\n added as the kernel command\
          \ line option</li>\n</ul>\n<p><code>elevator=noop</code></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Virtual\
          \ Machine disk partitions should be correctly alligned to the underlying\n\
          \ filesystem, otherwise I/O performance will be degraded. A quick way to\
          \ check if\n your Virtual Machine's partition alligned is to check with\
          \ <code>fdisk -lu</code>.\n Each partition should start on sector divisible\
          \ by 8.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After the performance tuning and you still have\
          \ slow storage access, you can\ncontact the NeCTAR help desk.</p>"

  html: "<h1>Storage</h1>\n<p>This section describes more advanced topics about storage\
    \ available for Virtual\nMachines in NecTAR Cloud.</p>\n<h2>Ephemeral storage</h2>\n\
    <p>Each virtual Machine you start on the NeCTAR cloud comes with a certain amount\n\
    of on-instance storage based on the flavour of your Virtual Machine, which\nappear\
    \ as two separate hard disks.</p>\n<p>Note: On instance storage is reguarded as\
    \ ephemeral, you should treat it as\nscratch space and keep important data in\
    \ either Volume or Object storage.</p>\n<h3>Primary Disk (10GB)</h3>\n<p>Every\
    \ Instance has a 10GB primary disk which is used for the image you launch.\nThe\
    \ Primary disk is copied in a snapshot, so anything on this primary disk can\n\
    be backed up via snapshots.</p>\n<p>The name of this device as seen from the instance\
    \ is usually /dev/vda.</p>\n<p>The size of primary disk can be vary for non-standard\
    \ flavour Virtual Machines.</p>\n<h3>Secondary Disk, 30GB to 480GB</h3>\n<p>This\
    \ appears as a second hard disk in your Virtual Machine, that you can format\n\
    and use as you wish. For every CPU an instance will get 30GB of additional\nsecondary\
    \ storage.</p>\n<p>The size of secondary disk can be vary for non-standard flavour\
    \ Virtual\nMachines.</p>\n<p>Note: The secondary disk is not copied or backed\
    \ up via snapshots.</p>\n<p>The name of this device as seen from the instance\
    \ is usually /dev/vdb and some\nOperating Systems will automatically format and\
    \ mount the secondary disk.</p>\n<p>For example, Ubuntu creates an ext3 partition\
    \ and mounts it at /mnt</p>\n<p>you can also format it directly, by executing:</p>\n\
    <p><code>mkfs.ext4 /dev/vdb</code></p>\n<p>Then you can mount to any directory\
    \ you like, by executing:\nmount /dev/vdb /mount point</p>\n<h3>Backup of Secondary\
    \ or Ephemeral drivers</h3>\n<p>Data on the secondary drive does not get saved\
    \ in a snapshot, and requires other\nstorage and techniques to make a backup.\
    \ For example, rsync</p>\n<h2>Volume Storage</h2>\n<p>Persistent volume storage\
    \ can live outside your Virtual Machine. It is appears\nas block storage which\
    \ can be attached then accessed and even booted from.\nThis is a storage volume\
    \ that you can attach to from within your Virtual Machine,\nread and write data,\
    \ detach it, and make it available to another Virtual Machine\n(in same availability\
    \ zone). Your data on a persistent volume is retained even\nwhen you terminate\
    \ your instance. Persistent Volumes offer a snapshot feature\nwhich can be used\
    \ to make convenient backups\n(uses some of your overall volume quota).</p>\n\
    <p>Volume storage are local services and only Virtual Machines in the same\navailability\
    \ zone can access it.</p>\n<p>The below guide shows how to use a volume storage\
    \ via command line are are more\nfor advanced users. For a basic introduction\
    \ and instruction for DashBoard,\nplease refer to the storage introduction article\
    \ in the Cloud Basic section.</p>\n<p>There are API clients you can use for management\
    \ of volumes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The OpenStack <a href=\"http://docs.openstack.org/developer/python-novaclient/man/nova.html\"\
    >python-cinderclient</a> has a wide range of commands\n to work with volume storage\
    \ (create, delete, snapshot)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The OpenStack <a href=\"http://docs.openstack.org/developer/python-novaclient/man/nova.html\"\
    >python-novaclient</a> to attach and detach volumes to\n instances</p>\n</li>\n\
    </ul>\n<p>Please refer to the relevant <a href=\"http://docs.openstack.org/user-guide/common/cli_install_openstack_command_line_clients.html\"\
    >document</a> for how to install the\nabove API clients.</p>\n<p>Before you can\
    \ use the python-cinderclient and python-novaclient you need to be\nauthenticated\
    \ to the NeCTAR cloud. The below shows the instructions of how to\nget username/password\
    \ and authenticated.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Login to NeCTAR Cloud <a href=\"https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au\"\
    >Dashboard</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click 'Access &amp; Security'</p>\n</li>\n\
    <li>\n<p>On the 'Access &amp; Security' page, click tab 'API Access'</p>\n</li>\n\
    <li>\n<p>Click button \"Download OpenStack RC File\"</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Save\
    \ the file into a directory</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click the drop down list with\
    \ your email on the right top of page, then click\n Settings</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\
    <p>Click 'Reset Password' and save the password appeared on the screen</p>\n</li>\n\
    </ul>\n<p>API normally requires 4 variables to be set for authentication:</p>\n\
    <ul>\n<li>auth URL</li>\n<li>username</li>\n<li>project id or name (most clients\
    \ can handle either)</li>\n<li>password</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When using the script\
    \ file you downloaded from NeCTAR Dashboard, these\nvarilabels are set by the\
    \ script file and you can see these variables\nif you open the file. Example:</p>\n\
    <p>OS_AUTH_URL: https://keystone.rc.nectar.org.au:5000/v2.0/\nOS_TENANT_NAME=my_science_project\n\
    OS_TENANT_ID=sdfsdfsfwrwewer\nOS_USERNAME=clouduser@example.edu.au\nOS_PASSWORD=XXXXXX</p>\n\
    <p>The below instruction assumes you use Linux operating system.</p>\n<p>Once\
    \ you have obtained the authentication script and password, you can execute\n\
    the script suing <code>source file-name.sh</code>. and type in the password you\n\
    obtained from Dashboard.</p>\n<h3>Nova API Client</h3>\n<p>To List volumes, execute\
    \ <code>nova volume-list</code></p>\n<p>To View details of a volume, execute <code>nova\
    \ volume-show volume-id</code>, you\nneed to replace the volume-id with the id\
    \ you obtained from nova volume-list</p>\n<p>To Create volume, execute</p>\n<p><code>nova\
    \ volume-create --display-name name--display-description description size</code></p>\n\
    <p>Arguments:\ndisplay-name: volume name\ndisplay-description volume description\n\
    size: volume size in GB</p>\n<p>To Delete volume, execute\n<code>nova volume-delete\
    \ &lt;volume&gt;</code></p>\n<p>Positional arguments:\n<volume>: Name or ID of\
    \ the volume to delete</p>\n<p>To Attach volume to a Virtual Machine, use command:</p>\n\
    <p><code>nova volume-attach &lt;server&gt; &lt;volume&gt; [&lt;device&gt;]</code></p>\n\
    <p>Positional arguments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>server:  Name or ID of server</p>\n\
    </li>\n<li>\n<p>volume:  ID of the volume to attach</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>device:\
    \  Name of the device e.g. /dev/vdb. Use auto for auto assign</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\
    <p>OpenStack currently ignores the specified device when attaching volumes, you\
    \ can\nspecify 'auto' to let OpenStack to decide.\nOpenStack adds the volume as\
    \ the lowest available device name:</p>\n<p>For a standard flavor Virtual Machine\
    \ (with a primary &amp; secondary drive) the\nfirst volume will be attached as\
    \ /dev/vdc.</p>\n<p>You can always execute <code>nova</code> to see what volume\
    \ command available and\nexecute <code>nova help volume command</code> for help\
    \ of the specific volume\ncommand.</p>\n<h3>Cinder API Client</h3>\n<p>Cinder\
    \ is an OpenStack project to provide \"block storage as a service\"</p>\n<p>To\
    \ List volumes, execute <code>cinder list</code></p>\n<p>To Show details of a\
    \ volume, execute <code>cinder show &lt;volume&gt;</code></p>\n<p>Positional arguments:</p>\n\
    <ul>\n<li>volume:  Name or ID of the volume.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To Create volume,\
    \ execute\n<code>cinder create --display-name name --display-description description\
    \ size</code></p>\n<p>Positional arguments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>display-name:\
    \ volume name</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>display-description volume description</p>\n\
    </li>\n<li>\n<p>size: volume size in GB</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can also create\
    \ a volume based on an existing volume or image by adding the\nthe following 2\
    \ arguments to cinder create command:</p>\n<p>--source-volid <source-volid>: Create\
    \ volume from volume id (Optional, Default=None)</p>\n<p>--image-id <image-id>\
    \ Create volume from image id (Optional, Default=None)</p>\n<p>To Delete volume,\
    \ execute</p>\n<p><code>cinder delete &lt;volume&gt;</code></p>\n<p>Positional\
    \ arguments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>volume: Name or ID of the volume to delete</li>\n\
    </ul>\n<p>To Rename volume, execute\n<code>cinder rename &lt;volume&gt; [&lt;display-name&gt;]</code></p>\n\
    <p>Positional arguments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>volume: Name or ID of the volume\
    \ to rename.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>display-name: New display-name for the volume.</p>\n\
    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cinder also provides other volume related commands such as backup,\
    \ snapshot and\nvolume type.</p>\n<p>You can always execute <code>cinder</code>\
    \ to see what volume command available and\nexecute <code>cinder help command</code>\
    \ for help of the specific volume command.</p>\n<p>Notes:\nThere are more API\
    \ clients avaible to manage the Volument Storage, please refer\nto the releanve\
    \ documents or search through Internet.</p>\n<h3>Client Python API</h3>\n<p>Rather\
    \ than running the client API in command line, Client API can also be used\nwithin\
    \ the Python code.</p>\n<p>The nova and cinder Python API client can be installed\
    \ easily by using pip\ncommand. Please refer to the relevant <a href=\"https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html\"\
    >document</a> for installation of pip.</p>\n<p>The below shows a sample python\
    \ code of using Nova Python API:</p>\n<p><code>from novaclient import client\n\
    nova = client.Client(VERSION, USERNAME, PASSWORD, PROJECT_NAME, AUTH_URL)\nnova.volumes.create(parameters)\n\
    nova.volumes.delete(parameters)\nnova.volumes.create_server_volume(parameters)</code></p>\n\
    <p>The VERSION parameter can be \"1.1\" or \"2\"</p>\n<p>create method is used\
    \ to create a new volume and it takes below parameters:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>size:\
    \  Size of volume in GB</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>snapshot_id:  ID of the snapshot</p>\n\
    </li>\n<li>\n<p>display_name  Name of the volume</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>display_description\
    \  Description of the volume</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>volume_type  Type of volume</p>\n\
    </li>\n<li>\n<p>availability_zone  Availability Zone for volume</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\
    <p>imageRef  reference to an image stored in glance</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Return\
    \ type:\nVolume</p>\n<p>delete method is used to delete a volume and it takes\
    \ below arguments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>volumen: The Volume to delete</li>\n</ul>\n\
    <p>create_server_volume is used to attach a volume to a Virtual Machine and takes\n\
    below arguments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>server_id: The ID of the server</p>\n</li>\n\
    <li>\n<p>volume_id: The ID of the volume to attach</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>device:\
    \ the device name</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To get username, password and other information,\
    \ you can refer back the\nauthentication script obtained from NeCTAR Cloud <a\
    \ href=\"https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au\">Dashboard</a>.</p>\n<p>To see more\
    \ information please refer to <a href=\"http://docs.openstack.org/developer/python-novaclient/api.html\"\
    >Nova Python API</a></p>\n<p>The below shows a sample python code of using Cinder\
    \ Python API:</p>\n<p><code>from cinderclient import client\ncinder = client.Client(VERSION,\
    \ USERNAME, PASSWORD, PROJECT_NAME, AUTH_URL)\ncinder.volumes.list()\ncinder.attach(parameters)\n\
    cinder.get(parameters)</code></p>\n<p>list method is used to list all volumes\
    \ in the project</p>\n<p>attach method is used to attach volume to an Virtual\
    \ Machine and it takes below\nparameters:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>volume: The :class:<code>Volume</code>\
    \ (or its ID) you would like to attach.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>instance_uuid: uuid\
    \ of the attaching instance.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>mountpoint: mountpoint on the\
    \ attaching instance.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>mode: the access mode.</p>\n</li>\n\
    </ul>\n<p>get method is to get details of a volume and it takes below parameters:</p>\n\
    <ul>\n<li>volume_id: The ID of the volume to get</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To see more information\
    \ and commands please refer to\n<a href=\"http://docs.openstack.org/developer/python-cinderclient/\"\
    >Cinder Python API</a></p>\n<h3>Boot from Volume</h3>\n<p>You can use the below\
    \ command to boot from volume:</p>\n<p><code>nova boot --flavor m1.small --key_name\
    \ &lt;mykey&gt; --block_device_mapping vda=&lt;volume-id&gt;:::0 &lt;instance_name&gt;</code></p>\n\
    <p>Note:\nChanging the '0' to '1' changes the delete_on_terminate option to delete\
    \ the\nvolume on instance termination</p>\n<h3>Use Volume within Virtual Machine</h3>\n\
    <p>A new Volume may not have a filesystem (depending on how it was created) and\
    \ you\nneed to create one before mounting.</p>\n<p>The exact mount command syntax\
    \ is dependent on the Virtual Machines' operating\nsystem and the type of filesystem\
    \ you require.</p>\n<p>You can use the below command to create ext4 file system\
    \ and assumes volume is\non vdc:</p>\n<p><code>sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/vdc</code></p>\n\
    <p>Warning: creating new file system can cause data loss if a filesystem already\n\
    exists on the target volume.</p>\n<p>The exact mount command syntax is dependent\
    \ on the Virtual Machine' Operating\nSystem, so the advice can only be generic.\
    \ eg</p>\n<p><code>sudo mount /dev/vdc /mnt -t auto</code></p>\n<p>This will mount\
    \ the disk if the type of file-system can be guessed, otherwise\nyou may have\
    \ to specify \"-t file-system-type\".</p>\n<p>If you did not create and format\
    \ the Volume then you might work out the\nfile-system type by executing the below\
    \ command:</p>\n<p><code>sudo parted -l</code></p>\n<p>Finally if you want the\
    \ filesystem auto-mounted at boot consider changing the\n\"/etc/fstab\" (or equivalent\
    \ for your OS) which specifies devices and mountpoints\nand whether to mount them\
    \ automatically or just be aware they exist and allow\nsimplified mounting sytax\
    \ such as:</p>\n<p><code>mount  /mnt\nor\nmount /device</code></p>\n<h2>Object\
    \ Storage</h2>\n<p>Object Storage is not a traditional file-system or real-time\
    \ data storage system.\nIt's designed for mostly static data that can be retrieved,\
    \ leveraged, and then\nupdated if necessary. It is independant of a particular\
    \ Virtual Machine and can\nbe updated and used without having any Virtual Machine\
    \ running. It is designed\nto be redundant and scalable.</p>\n<h3>Concept</h3>\n\
    <p>Think about that dataset comprised of 2GB files that you read in and analyse\n\
    many times, but in general it doesn't change. Or the images you want to use on\n\
    the cloud. Those are a couple examples of what's perfect for Object Storage.\n\
    Objects are written to multiple hardware devices in the data cente to ensure\n\
    integrity, and great performance!</p>\n<p>In general, the object store is great\
    \ for data you write once and read many\ntimes, but not suitable for applications\
    \ like databases. It's the safest place\nto put your data on the NeCTAR Research\
    \ Cloud as multiple redundant copies of\nyour data are made, and it has great\
    \ performance. You can access the object\nstore from anywhere on the Internet,\
    \ and data from Object Storage can be\ntransferred to and from your Virtual Machine\
    \ with a variety of http-capable\ntools.</p>\n<h3>Swift</h3>\n<p>Swift is the\
    \ component that provides object storage for OpenStack. With your\ncredentials\
    \ and via a URL you can request Swift to reserve &amp; create storage\n(called\
    \ containers or buckets). Files (known as objects when stored in Swift)\ncan then\
    \ be uploaded and accessed similarly by your running Virtual Machines.</p>\n<p>The\
    \ NeCTAR implementation of Swift is geodistributed across Nodes of the\nResearch\
    \ Cloud so that availability is not reliant on any one datacentre or\nnetwork\
    \ infrastructure. Each collection of Swift nodes/hardware is known as a\nregion,\
    \ which may or may not include a Swift proxy server (the Internet facing\nand\
    \ serving component of Swift). With some Swift clients/APIs users can\nexplicitly\
    \ chose which proxy to connect to, this might be useful e.g. for\nspeeding up\
    \ writes to object storage by choosing the nearest proxy. Due to\nNeCTAR's Swift\
    \ having multiple regions (some of which are Node private) some\nclients/APIs\
    \ require explicit configuration of a default region, which should\nbe \"Melbourne\"\
    \ for most users.</p>\n<p>Swift does not provide encryption of the data it stores.\
    \ If you have sensitive\ndata that requires encryption you must encrypt the data\
    \ files before upload.</p>\n<h3>Swift Command Line Client</h3>\n<p>The swift client\
    \ is the command-line interface (CLI) for the OpenStack Object\nAPI and its extensions.</p>\n\
    <p>It is same as nova client and cinder lcient, you need to authente before you\
    \ can\nuse the it. Please refer the above instruction about how to get authenticated.</p>\n\
    <p>Please also refer above instruction for how to install the swift client.</p>\n\
    <p>To list all containers, execute:</p>\n<p><code>swift list</code></p>\n<p>To\
    \ list all objects under a container, execute:</p>\n<p><code>swift list [container]</code></p>\n\
    <p>Positional arguments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>container: Name of container to list object\
    \ in</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To create a container, execute</p>\n<p><code>swift post [container]</code></p>\n\
    <p>Positional arguments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>container: Name of container to create</li>\n\
    </ul>\n<p>To delete a container and a object within it, execute:</p>\n<p><code>swift\
    \ delete [container][object]</code></p>\n<p>Positional arguments:\ncontainer:\
    \ Name of container to delete from\nobject: Name of object ot delete. Specify\
    \ multiple times for multiple objects</p>\n<p>To upload files or directories to\
    \ the given container, execute:</p>\n<p><code>swift upload &lt;container&gt; &lt;file_or_directory&gt;</code></p>\n\
    <p>Positional arguments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>container: Name of container to upload\
    \ to</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>file_or_directory: Name of file or directory to uploaded.\
    \ Specify multiple\n times for multiple uploads</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To download\
    \ objects from a given container, execute:</p>\n<p><code>swift download &lt;container&gt;\
    \ [object]</code></p>\n<p>Positional arguments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>container:\
    \ Name of container to download from. To download a whole account,\n omit this\
    \ and specify --all</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>object: Name of object to download. Specify\
    \ multiple times for multiple\n objects. Omit this to download all objects from\
    \ the container</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can execute <code>swift</code> to see\
    \ what commands are avaiable and\nrun <code>swift command -h</code> find out more\
    \ information about a command.</p>\n<h3>Client python API</h3>\n<p>You can also\
    \ use swift python API to access and manage the object storage.\nThe below shows\
    \ the sample Pthon code:</p>\n<p>```\nfrom swiftclient import client</p>\n<p>swift\
    \ = client.Connection(authurl=url, user=username, key=password,\ntenant_name=project_name,\
    \ auth_version='2')</p>\n<p>container_name=\"\"\nswift.get_container(container_name)</p>\n\
    <p>container_name=\"first container\"\nswift.put_container(container_name)</p>\n\
    <p>swift.delete_container(container_name)</p>\n<p>container_name = \"container\"\
    \nobject_name = \"object\"\nswift.get_object(container_name, object_name)</p>\n\
    <p>swift.put_object(container_name, object)\n```</p>\n<p>Please refer to above\
    \ instruction about how to obtain authurl, user, password and\ntenant_name.</p>\n\
    <p>To get a container, use swift.get_container(container_name) method, if you\n\
    provide a empty string to the container_name parameter, it returns all\ncontainers\
    \ in your project.</p>\n<p>To create a container, use swift.post_container(container_name)\
    \ method.</p>\n<p>To delete a container, use swift.delete_container(container_name)\
    \ method.</p>\n<p>To get a object, use swift.get_object(container_name, object_name)\
    \ method.</p>\n<p>To upload a object, use swift.put_object(container_name, object)\
    \ method.</p>\n<p>Please refer to the <a href=\"http://docs.openstack.org/developer/python-swiftclient/index.html\"\
    >swift python cliet document</a> for more\ninformation.</p>\n<h2>Storage Performance</h2>\n\
    <p>Storage performance is various based on that the implementation of each node\
    \ may\ntake different storage approach and due to differences in hardware. For\
    \ example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>faster spindle speeds</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>SSD\
    \ cache</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>local storage on compute nodes</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\
    <p>shared storage across compute nodes</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>underline network\
    \ infrastructure</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The storage performance also depends largely\
    \ on the choice of file system and\nthe way how applications operates.</p>\n<p>The\
    \ below tables shows a comparison of various data storage features:</p>\n<table>\n\
    <thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Storage type</th>\n<th>Saved in snapshot</th>\n<th>Data integrity</th>\n\
    <th>Access</th>\n<th>Back up</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>On-instance\
    \ Primary Disk</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>Ok</td>\n<td>Block</td>\n<td>No</td>\n\
    </tr>\n<tr>\n<td>On-instance Secondary Disk</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>Ok</td>\n<td>Block</td>\n\
    <td>No</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Volumes</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>Good</td>\n<td>Block</td>\n\
    <td>No</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Object Storage</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>Best</td>\n\
    <td>HTTP</td>\n<td>No</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Notes:\nData Integrity\
    \ means how your data exposed to hardware errors.\nAccess means how storage gets\
    \ access through eith Block level device (like\nattaching a hard drive to a computer)\
    \ or HTTP where you use access data\nvia HTTP protocol.\nBack up means whehter\
    \ there is a recoverable copy of a file available after a\nfile is updated, deleted\
    \ or damaged.</p>\n<h3>Performance Tuning</h3>\n<p>If you experience slow storage\
    \ access, some storage performance tuning can be\ndone inside the Virtual Machine.</p>\n\
    <ul>\n<li>Use the noop I/O scheduler if possibile. Other Virtual machine scheduler\n\
    \ conflicts with hypervisor scheduler. If the device boots with grub, this can\
    \ be\n added as the kernel command line option</li>\n</ul>\n<p><code>elevator=noop</code></p>\n\
    <ul>\n<li>Virtual Machine disk partitions should be correctly alligned to the\
    \ underlying\n filesystem, otherwise I/O performance will be degraded. A quick\
    \ way to check if\n your Virtual Machine's partition alligned is to check with\
    \ <code>fdisk -lu</code>.\n Each partition should start on sector divisible by\
    \ 8.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After the performance tuning and you still have slow storage\
    \ access, you can\ncontact the NeCTAR help desk.</p>"

        desc_un_html: " This glossary aims to demystify some of the unavoidable jargon\
          \ and acronyms that\ncome with moving into the cloud.  Like for example,\
          \ what is the cloud exactly? \n \n The Cloud \n \n Getting a good definition\
          \ of \"cloud\" is hard.  The cloud is many things to many\npeople, and it's\
          \ somewhat a matter of perspective.  I asked\nthe question on a sysadmin\
          \ IRC channel once, and the answers i received caused\nas much debate and\
          \ controversy as provided actual insight. \n \"..[a cloud is] a network\
          \ of remote servers hosted on the Internet and used to\nstore, manage, and\
          \ process data in place of local servers or personal computers\n..\" Oxford\
          \ Dictionary \n But that's not the complete answer.  There are private clouds,\
          \ and local clouds,\nand public clouds.  They don't have to be connected\
          \ to the internet and the\nworkloads they achieve are not always a direct\
          \ replacement of traditional\ncomputing effort.  A better answer might be\
          \ that a cloud is; \n \".. a network of servers used to store, manage, and\
          \ process data to achieve\nefficiencies of scale in completing various computational\
          \ tasks.  They are\ntypified by their automation, scalability and opacity..\"\
          \ \n There is also the NIST definition of cloud computing\nwhich emphasizes\
          \ the essential characteristics, service models and deployment\nmodels.\
          \ \n \n OpenStack \n \n is thankfully easier to define, \"..OpenStack is\
          \ a free and open-source cloud\ncomputing software platform. Users primarily\
          \ deploy it as an infrastructure as\na service (IaaS) solution. The technology\
          \ consists of a series of interrelated\nprojects that control pools of processing,\
          \ storage, and networking resources\nthroughout a data center which users\
          \ manage through a web-based dashboard,\ncommand-line tools, or a RESTful\
          \ API...\" Wikipedia \n Ok, and what's IaaS? And RESTful? and API?? Good\
          \ questions, keep reading .. :) \n Thanks \n This content heavily sourced\
          \ from the excellent eSpaces glossary\nproduced by Steve Crawley at QCIF.\

          \ for security group. \n \n Access Rule \n \n OpenStack terminology - a\
          \ security group is a set of access rules.  An access\nrule allow network\
          \ access to an instance from other hosts with a specified\ncombination of\
          \ protocol family (e.g. TCP, UDP, UCMP), port number and address\n range.\
          \ \n At NeCTAR by the default security group applied to new instances does\
          \ not\ncontain an access rule for ssh.  Meaning that new users often find\
          \ their new\nvirtual machines inaccessable via ssh until they add the appropriate\
          \ access\nrule. \n \n Account \n \n NeCTAR and OpenStack terminology. A\
          \ synonym for \"project\" and \"tenant\". \n \n Active Directory (AD) \n\
          \ \n Microsoft's directory service product; essentially LDAP enhanced with\

          \ from a user interface, which is designed for\npeople to use.) \n \n API\
          \ endpoint \n \n See service endpoint. \n \n apt \n \n apt is the name of\
          \ the package manager used by the Debian family\n(Debian/Ubuntu/Mint) of\
          \ distros.  It is a simple and elegant way to install\nsoftware on your\
          \ Debian server.  Conceptually remote \"repositories\" contain\nmassive\
          \ amounts of software (called \"packages\" and by using the apt-get\ncommand,\
          \ you can download and install any of it using a simple command.  Apt\n\
          maintains a local database that tracks which packages you have installed\
          \ and\nmanages the additional packages your original package depends on\
          \ (the\n\"dependencies\").  Before apt and other such package managers,\
          \ managing\ndependencies was a difficult and manual process. Apt uses the\
          \ .deb file format\nfor distributing packages both inside and outside of\
          \ package repositories. \n \n AMD \n \n Advanced Micro Devices Inc. A manufacturer\
          \ of x86 and x86_64 compatible\nmicroprocessors.  In 2006 AMD aquired ATI,\
          \ a manufacturer of high end graphics\nchipsets, maing AMD a powerhouse\
          \ of CPU and GPU hardware.  A direct competitor\nto Intel. \n \n Aspera\

          \ be attached to an OpenStack instance to provide it with\n additional disk\
          \ storage. \n \n Authentication \n \n The process of establishing that an\
          \ agent (i.e. a person, or other entity) in a\n computer system is who they\
          \ say they are.  The simple username and password\nis the most familiar\
          \ means of authentication. \n \n Availability Zone (or AZ) \n \n OpenStack\

          \ \n \n Boot \n \n The boot (or \"bootstrap\") process is the means by which\
          \ the computer starts\nitself up after the power button is pressed.  Ultimately\
          \ booting is the process\nin which a computer goes from having empty memory\
          \ to having the operating\nsystem loaded and running. \n \n Bricked \n \n\
          \ Colloquialism: describes a system that has been damaged in a way that\n\
          permanently locks out some or all functionality.  It's usually the consequence\n\
          of some kind of firmware update that fails to run properly, or at all, meaning\n\
          further remedial firmware updates are not possible.  The device is bricked\
          \ when\nit can't be fixed and is effectively an expensive square shaped\
          \ \"brick\". \n \n Canonical \n \n Canonical Ltd. is a UK-based privately\
          \ held computer software company founded\n(and funded) by South African\
          \ entrepreneur Mark Shuttleworth to market\ncommercial support and services\
          \ for Ubuntu and related projects\nWikipedia \n \n CDS \n \n RDSI terminology\

          \ systems to acquire all of the measurements they need to\nestablish customer\
          \ billing, across all current OpenStack core components. \n It is also a\
          \ means by which to gather performance related metrics useful for the\n\
          general management of the OpenStack environment in general. \n \n Cell \n\
          \ \n Cells are a means by which to partition an OpenStack compute cloud\
          \ into groups. \n At NeCTAR each site runs a different configuration, as\
          \ a resource cells in an\nOpenStack Compute cells setup. This allows the\
          \ NeCTAR nodes to do different\nthings such as span multiple data centers,\
          \ or run off compute node storage with a\nshared file system, or use on\
          \ compute node storage with a non-shared file\nsystem.  It's also a way\
          \ to partition tenants and accounts. \n \n CentOS \n \n A community-based\
          \ rebadging of RHEL distros.  The result is \"for free\", but with\n no\
          \ support. \n \n Ceph \n \n \"Ceph is a unified, distributed storage system\

          \ by AARNET. Allows researchers\n to send and receive large files (up to\
          \ 100Gb) or the big brother CloudStor+\nwhich is an enhanced version of\

          \ Stored as part of a data storage investment\nproject called RDSI (Research\
          \ Data Storage Infrastructure). Operators of the\ninfrastructure from RDSI\
          \ project are called RDSI nodes and may still refer to\ntheir storage facilities\

          \ \n Compute Node \n \n OpenStack terminology for a physical computer used\
          \ to run virtual machines.\nIt will typically have multiple CPUs and shared\
          \ memory, and one or more network\ninterfaces.  It may also have on-node\

          \ isolated from each other and the computer itself.\nSimilar in concept\
          \ to Virtualisation, however not as broadly applicable because\nthe containers\
          \ must be the same operating system as the host itself. \n Containers may\
          \ one day be possible within OpenStack, however it has been the\nmain focus\
          \ of that project to achieve scalable virtualisation. \n \n Copyleft \n\

          \ Storage Management (HSM) system by SGI designed for\nthe bulk storage\
          \ of data. The basic premise is that fast storage is expensive so\nwouldn't\
          \ it be cool if we could put only the data we actually use on the fast\n\
          storage, and the rest can kind of trickle through less expensive storage\
          \ layers.\nSo the hierachy is in fact a sandwidge of storage technologies\
          \ (usually ssd,\nhdd, tape) at each of which the storage cost per gigabyte\
          \ decreases.  As data\nages through the layers the usual trade off is speed,\
          \ so ideally frequently used\ndata stays on the faster storage layer.  Conversely,\
          \ data which is seldom\naccessed is often archived off to tape where the\
          \ cost per gigabyte is very low.\nMagical filesystems ideally make all of\
          \ this invisible to users and\napplications.  Usually highly expensive and\
          \ complicated, it's pretty awesome\nwhen it works. SGI DMF \n \n Docker\

        description: "<p>This glossary aims to demystify some of the unavoidable jargon\

          \ what is the cloud exactly?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Cloud</p>\n</blockquote>\n\
          <p>Getting a good definition of \"cloud\" is hard.  The cloud is many things\
          \ to many\npeople, and it's somewhat a matter of perspective.  I asked\n\
          the question on a sysadmin IRC channel once, and the answers i received\
          \ caused\nas much debate and controversy as provided actual insight.</p>\n\
          <p>\"..[a cloud is] a network of remote servers hosted on the Internet and\
          \ used to\nstore, manage, and process data in place of local servers or\
          \ personal computers\n..\" <a href=\"http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/cloud-computing\"\
          >Oxford Dictionary</a></p>\n<p>But that's not the complete answer.  There\
          \ are private clouds, and local clouds,\nand public clouds.  They don't\
          \ have to be connected to the internet and the\nworkloads they achieve are\
          \ not always a direct replacement of traditional\ncomputing effort.  A better\
          \ answer might be that a cloud is;</p>\n<p>\".. a network of servers used\
          \ to store, manage, and process data to achieve\nefficiencies of scale in\
          \ completing various computational tasks.  They are\ntypified by their automation,\
          \ scalability and opacity..\"</p>\n<p>There is also the <a href=\"http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-145/SP800-145.pdf\"\
          >NIST definition of cloud computing</a>\nwhich emphasizes the essential\
          \ characteristics, service models and deployment\nmodels.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\
          <p>OpenStack</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>is thankfully easier to define, \"..OpenStack\
          \ is a free and open-source cloud\ncomputing software platform. Users primarily\
          \ deploy it as an infrastructure as\na service (IaaS) solution. The technology\
          \ consists of a series of interrelated\nprojects that control pools of processing,\
          \ storage, and networking resources\nthroughout a data center which users\
          \ manage through a web-based dashboard,\ncommand-line tools, or a RESTful\
          \ API...\" <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenStack\">Wikipedia</a></p>\n\

          <p>OpenStack terminology - a synonym for security group.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\
          <p>Access Rule</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>OpenStack terminology - a security\
          \ group is a set of access rules.  An access\nrule allow network access\
          \ to an instance from other hosts with a specified\ncombination of protocol\
          \ family (e.g. TCP, UDP, UCMP), port number and address\n range.</p>\n<p>At\
          \ NeCTAR by the default security group applied to new instances does not\n\
          contain an access rule for ssh.  Meaning that new users often find their\
          \ new\nvirtual machines inaccessable via ssh until they add the appropriate\
          \ access\nrule.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Account</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>NeCTAR\

          <p>apt</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>apt is the name of the package manager used\
          \ by the Debian family\n(Debian/Ubuntu/Mint) of distros.  It is a simple\
          \ and elegant way to install\nsoftware on your Debian server.  Conceptually\
          \ remote \"repositories\" contain\nmassive amounts of software (called \"\
          packages\" and by using the <code>apt-get</code>\ncommand, you can download\
          \ and install any of it using a simple command.  Apt\nmaintains a local\
          \ database that tracks which packages you have installed and\nmanages the\
          \ additional packages your original package depends on (the\n\"dependencies\"\
          ).  Before apt and other such package managers, managing\ndependencies was\
          \ a difficult and manual process. Apt uses the .deb file format\nfor distributing\
          \ packages both inside and outside of package repositories.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\

          \ Management (HSM) system by SGI designed for\nthe bulk storage of data.\
          \ The basic premise is that fast storage is expensive so\nwouldn't it be\
          \ cool if we could put only the data we actually use on the fast\nstorage,\
          \ and the rest can kind of trickle through less expensive storage layers.\n\
          So the hierachy is in fact a sandwidge of storage technologies (usually\
          \ ssd,\nhdd, tape) at each of which the storage cost per gigabyte decreases.\
          \  As data\nages through the layers the usual trade off is speed, so ideally\
          \ frequently used\ndata stays on the faster storage layer.  Conversely,\
          \ data which is seldom\naccessed is often archived off to tape where the\
          \ cost per gigabyte is very low.\nMagical filesystems ideally make all of\
          \ this invisible to users and\napplications.  Usually highly expensive and\
          \ complicated, it's pretty awesome\nwhen it works. <a href=\"https://www.sgi.com/products/storage/idm/dmf.html\"\

  html: "<p>This glossary aims to demystify some of the unavoidable jargon and acronyms\
    \ that\ncome with moving into the cloud.  Like for example, what is the cloud\
    \ exactly?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Cloud</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Getting a good\
    \ definition of \"cloud\" is hard.  The cloud is many things to many\npeople,\
    \ and it's somewhat a matter of perspective.  I asked\nthe question on a sysadmin\
    \ IRC channel once, and the answers i received caused\nas much debate and controversy\
    \ as provided actual insight.</p>\n<p>\"..[a cloud is] a network of remote servers\
    \ hosted on the Internet and used to\nstore, manage, and process data in place\
    \ of local servers or personal computers\n..\" <a href=\"http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/cloud-computing\"\
    >Oxford Dictionary</a></p>\n<p>But that's not the complete answer.  There are\
    \ private clouds, and local clouds,\nand public clouds.  They don't have to be\
    \ connected to the internet and the\nworkloads they achieve are not always a direct\
    \ replacement of traditional\ncomputing effort.  A better answer might be that\
    \ a cloud is;</p>\n<p>\".. a network of servers used to store, manage, and process\
    \ data to achieve\nefficiencies of scale in completing various computational tasks.\
    \  They are\ntypified by their automation, scalability and opacity..\"</p>\n<p>There\
    \ is also the <a href=\"http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-145/SP800-145.pdf\"\
    >NIST definition of cloud computing</a>\nwhich emphasizes the essential characteristics,\
    \ service models and deployment\nmodels.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>OpenStack</p>\n\
    </blockquote>\n<p>is thankfully easier to define, \"..OpenStack is a free and\
    \ open-source cloud\ncomputing software platform. Users primarily deploy it as\
    \ an infrastructure as\na service (IaaS) solution. The technology consists of\
    \ a series of interrelated\nprojects that control pools of processing, storage,\
    \ and networking resources\nthroughout a data center which users manage through\
    \ a web-based dashboard,\ncommand-line tools, or a RESTful API...\" <a href=\"\
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenStack\">Wikipedia</a></p>\n<p>Ok, and what's\
    \ IaaS? And RESTful? and API?? Good questions, keep reading .. :)</p>\n<h2>Thanks</h2>\n\

    <blockquote>\n<p>Access Control</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The process of determining\
    \ if an (authenticated) agent is permitted to perform\nsome action.  Synonym:\
    \ authorization.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Access Group</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>OpenStack\
    \ terminology - a synonym for security group.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Access Rule</p>\n\
    </blockquote>\n<p>OpenStack terminology - a security group is a set of access\
    \ rules.  An access\nrule allow network access to an instance from other hosts\
    \ with a specified\ncombination of protocol family (e.g. TCP, UDP, UCMP), port\
    \ number and address\n range.</p>\n<p>At NeCTAR by the default security group\
    \ applied to new instances does not\ncontain an access rule for ssh.  Meaning\
    \ that new users often find their new\nvirtual machines inaccessable via ssh until\
    \ they add the appropriate access\nrule.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Account</p>\n</blockquote>\n\
    <p>NeCTAR and OpenStack terminology. A synonym for \"project\" and \"tenant\"\
    .</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Active Directory (AD)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Microsoft's\
    \ directory service product; essentially LDAP enhanced with Kerberos.\nMost Microsoft\
    \ Windows environments will use AD to centrally control\n authentication.</p>\n\

    \ federated authentication\nservice for the Australian academic community.  Also\
    \ the name of the\norganization that runs the AAF service.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\
    <p>AARNET</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Australia's Academic &amp; Research Network -\
    \ the organization that runs the\nnetworks connecting Australia's Universities\

    <blockquote>\n<p>API endpoint</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See service endpoint.</p>\n\
    <blockquote>\n<p>apt</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>apt is the name of the package manager\
    \ used by the Debian family\n(Debian/Ubuntu/Mint) of distros.  It is a simple\
    \ and elegant way to install\nsoftware on your Debian server.  Conceptually remote\
    \ \"repositories\" contain\nmassive amounts of software (called \"packages\" and\
    \ by using the <code>apt-get</code>\ncommand, you can download and install any\
    \ of it using a simple command.  Apt\nmaintains a local database that tracks which\
    \ packages you have installed and\nmanages the additional packages your original\
    \ package depends on (the\n\"dependencies\").  Before apt and other such package\
    \ managers, managing\ndependencies was a difficult and manual process. Apt uses\
    \ the .deb file format\nfor distributing packages both inside and outside of package\
    \ repositories.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>AMD</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Advanced Micro\

    \ a Hierarchical Storage Management (HSM) system by SGI designed for\nthe bulk\

    \ it be cool if we could put only the data we actually use on the fast\nstorage,\
    \ and the rest can kind of trickle through less expensive storage layers.\nSo\
    \ the hierachy is in fact a sandwidge of storage technologies (usually ssd,\n\
    hdd, tape) at each of which the storage cost per gigabyte decreases.  As data\n\
    ages through the layers the usual trade off is speed, so ideally frequently used\n\
    data stays on the faster storage layer.  Conversely, data which is seldom\naccessed\
    \ is often archived off to tape where the cost per gigabyte is very low.\nMagical\
    \ filesystems ideally make all of this invisible to users and\napplications. \
    \ Usually highly expensive and complicated, it's pretty awesome\nwhen it works.\

          \ or real-time data storage system.\nIt's designed for mostly static data\
          \ that can be retrieved, leveraged, and then\nupdated if necessary. It is\
          \ independent of a particular Virtual Machine and can\nbe updated and used\
          \ without having any Virtual Machine running. It is designed\nto be redundant\
          \ and scalable. \n Concept \n Think about that dataset comprised of 2GB\
          \ files that you read in and analyze\nmany times, but in general it doesn't\
          \ change. Or the images you want to use on\nthe cloud. Those are a couple\
          \ examples of what's perfect for Object Storage.\nObjects are written to\
          \ multiple hardware devices in the data center to ensure\nintegrity, and\
          \ great performance! \n In general, the object store is great for data you\
          \ write once and read many\ntimes, but not suitable for applications like\
          \ databases. It's the safest place\nto put your data on the NeCTAR Research\
          \ Cloud as multiple redundant copies of\nyour data are made, and it has\
          \ great performance. You can access the object\nstore from anywhere on the\
          \ Internet, and data from Object Storage can be\ntransferred to and from\
          \ your Virtual Machine with a variety of http-capable\ntools. \n Object\
          \ Storage has the following features which are quite different from the\n\
          traditional file systems: \n \n \n Access via API at application-level,\
          \ rather than via OS at file-system-level.\n  This means, byte-level interaction\
          \ is not possible and interaction can occur\n  via a single API end point.\
          \ \n \n \n No directory tree, object storage uses a flat structure and objects\
          \ are stored\n  in containers. \n \n \n Metadata lives directly with object.\
          \ \n \n \n Scalability. Object storage systems can scale very well when\
          \ data reaches\n  hundreds of TB and moves into the PB range and beyond.\
          \ \n \n \n Durability. Object Storage systems have mechanisms to check file\
          \ consistency,\n  and handle failed drives, bit-rot, server and cabinet\
          \ failures, etc. These\n  features allow the system to automatically replicate\
          \ data as needed to retain\n  the desired number of replicas, which results\
          \ in extremely high durability\n  and availability of data. \n \n \n Cost.\
          \ Object storage systems are designed to run on commodity hardware, it is\n\
          \  cheaper compared to block or file storage. \n \n \n Swift \n Swift is\
          \ the component that provides object storage for OpenStack. With your\n\
          credentials and via a URL you can request Swift to reserve & create storage\n\
          (called containers or buckets). Files (known as objects when stored in Swift)\n\
          can then be uploaded and accessed similarly by your running Virtual Machines.\
          \ \n The NeCTAR implementation of Swift is geodistributed across Nodes of\
          \ the\nResearch Cloud so that availability is not reliant on any one datacentre\
          \ or\nnetwork infrastructure. Each collection of Swift nodes/hardware is\
          \ known as a\nregion, which may or may not include a Swift proxy server\
          \ (the Internet facing\nand serving component of Swift). With some Swift\
          \ clients/APIs users can\nexplicitly chose which proxy to connect to, this\
          \ might be useful e.g. for\nspeeding up writes to object storage by choosing\
          \ the nearest proxy. Due to\nNeCTAR's Swift having multiple regions (some\
          \ of which are Node private) some\nclients/APIs require explicit configuration\
          \ of a default region, which should\nbe \"Melbourne\" for most users. \n\
          \ Swift does not provide encryption of the data it stores. If you have sensitive\n\
          data that requires encryption you must encrypt the data files before upload. "

  html: "<h2>Object Storage</h2>\n<p>Object Storage is not a traditional file-system\
    \ or real-time data storage system.\nIt's designed for mostly static data that\
    \ can be retrieved, leveraged, and then\nupdated if necessary. It is independent\
    \ of a particular Virtual Machine and can\nbe updated and used without having\
    \ any Virtual Machine running. It is designed\nto be redundant and scalable.</p>\n\
    <h3>Concept</h3>\n<p>Think about that dataset comprised of 2GB files that you\
    \ read in and analyze\nmany times, but in general it doesn't change. Or the images\
    \ you want to use on\nthe cloud. Those are a couple examples of what's perfect\
    \ for Object Storage.\nObjects are written to multiple hardware devices in the\
    \ data center to ensure\nintegrity, and great performance!</p>\n<p>In general,\
    \ the object store is great for data you write once and read many\ntimes, but\
    \ not suitable for applications like databases. It's the safest place\nto put\
    \ your data on the NeCTAR Research Cloud as multiple redundant copies of\nyour\
    \ data are made, and it has great performance. You can access the object\nstore\
    \ from anywhere on the Internet, and data from Object Storage can be\ntransferred\
    \ to and from your Virtual Machine with a variety of http-capable\ntools.</p>\n\
    <p>Object Storage has the following features which are quite different from the\n\
    traditional file systems:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Access via API at application-level,\
    \ rather than via OS at file-system-level.\n  This means, byte-level interaction\
    \ is not possible and interaction can occur\n  via a single API end point.</p>\n\
    </li>\n<li>\n<p>No directory tree, object storage uses a flat structure and objects\
    \ are stored\n  in containers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Metadata lives directly with\
    \ object.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Scalability. Object storage systems can scale very\
    \ well when data reaches\n  hundreds of TB and moves into the PB range and beyond.</p>\n\
    </li>\n<li>\n<p>Durability. Object Storage systems have mechanisms to check file\
    \ consistency,\n  and handle failed drives, bit-rot, server and cabinet failures,\
    \ etc. These\n  features allow the system to automatically replicate data as needed\
    \ to retain\n  the desired number of replicas, which results in extremely high\
    \ durability\n  and availability of data.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Cost. Object storage\

    <p>When you log into the cloud for the first time, you are automatically granted\
    \ a\nProject Trial Research Allocation of two cores for three months. Project\
    \ Trials\nhave names like pt-2061.</p>\n<p>Within your default allocation you\
    \ can run:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a medium (two core) instance, or</li>\n<li>two small\
    \ (single core) instances.</li>\n<li>As you get near the end of Project Trial,\
    \ submit a request for more resources.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Before submitting a request,\
    \ increased access via your local node</h2>\n<p>If you are associated with one\
    \ of the cloud nodes you may be eligible for\naccess to a local allocation of\

          \ announcements for your OS \n If there is a security problem with your\
          \ Operating System, you need to find\nout as soon as possible. Find the\
          \ appropriate mailing list and keep an eye\nout for anything that requires\

          \ Your instances should be configured so they allow the minimum access required\n\
          to run their service. Please use a host-based firewall, in conjunction with\n\
          the cloud-provided firewall to manage access. \n Disable/Remove unneeded\
          \ accounts \n Keep an eye on the user accounts enabled on your system. Some\
          \ applications\ncreate default accounts which are insecure. You may also\
          \ open a temporary user\naccount to allow quick login for a task and leave\
          \ it forever. This may lead to\nsecurity issue later, and you need to regular\
          \ check and delete these user\naccounts. \n Disable SSH password login -\
          \ use keys \n With enough time and compute power it is possible for passwords\
          \ to be brute\nforce attacked. The average SSH server deals with thousands\
          \ of such attacks\nevery week, so use ssh keys. Ubuntu provides some good\
          \ documentation for it. \n Don't store keys on the image \n The cloud provides\
          \ a metadata service so you can download keys on boot, so\nyou don't need\
          \ to copy keys manually. This ensures that if your key is\ncompromised,\
          \ not all running instances of that image are compromised. \n Install ssh\
          \ attack banning tools \n Install a tools like fail2ban or denyhosts, which\
          \ checks log files for\nattempted breaches and then blocks malicious IP\
          \ addresses. \n Disable unneeded services \n Know what services run on your\
          \ image, and disable the unneeded ones before\nyou upload it. This reduces\
          \ the attack surface. \n Use Encrypted Communications \n Wherever possible,\
          \ use encrypted communications to avoid attacks which\nintercept data. \n\
          \ Use best-practices for logging \n Make sure that services are logging\
          \ to a secure location, that is as\ntamperproof as possible. If logging\
          \ remotely, ensure that it is done over\na secure channel so that eavesdroppers\
          \ cannot monitor what is happening on\nyour instance. \n Only open ports\
          \ for required services \n By default, virtual machines in NeCTAR has closed\
          \ all ports, so in order to make\nservices available to public, you need\
          \ to open certain ports for it. Before you\nopen a open, you need to think\
          \ carefully about what service associated with it\nand what is the intention.\
          \ Never open ports for non-service binded to it. \n Only grand sufficient\
          \ permission to user account \n When creating user account, make sure only\
          \ grand the permission sufficient for \nits use. Never grant extra permission\
          \ if it is not needed. \n Disable root access from ssh and use sudo if possible\
          \ \n Disable root user SSH login and setup user account with sudo permission\
          \ to\nperform administrator tasks. \n Use other port for SSH \n The SSH\
          \ service on the virtual machine uses port 22 by default. This port is \n\
          well-known and can attract many attackers. Use a custom ssh port other than\
          \ 22\nwill improve security. Be noted, the port number below 1024 is well\
          \ reserved and\nshouldn't be used for SSH. \n Read security guide for service\
          \ installed \n Before and after you install a new service on your virtual\

          \ machine) is a computing environment completed with virtual\nhardware devices\
          \ which simulates the real computer system. The instance normally\nruns\
          \ as a process in a physical computer system called host and you can boot\
          \ an\noperating system inside the virtual machine. The instance will be\
          \ tricked as it\nis running on a real computer system and it will run just\
          \ as it would on a real,\nphysical machine. \n Your instance's operating\
          \ system is stored on a virtual hard drive and it is\ncalled image. The\
          \ image is a big, multi-gigabtye file storage stored on storage.\nYou can\
          \ launch a instance by using different images (operating system) and you\n\
          can access it through SSH. As the instance thinks it runs in a 'real' computer\n\
          system, you can do anything just like a normal computer system. However,\
          \ there\nare still some cases that can be restricted by underline virtual\
          \ hardware support\nsuch as 3D graphics. \n The instance doesn't have any\
          \ knowledge about the underline hardware and all\nhardware are done by virtualization.\
          \ The instance only thinks that it uses the\nreal hardware. \n Instances\
          \ add some overhead as there are virtualization layer to support required\n\
          functions, so they won't be as fast as if you run operating system on real\n\
          hardware. \n Why is virtualization useful \n The virtualization is useful\
          \ in the below scenarios: \n \n \n flexibility. If you need more instances\
          \ or more computing power, simply launch\n more instances or launch a instance\
          \ with more CPUs and RAMs. This makes it is\n easy to copy with changes.\
          \ \n \n \n easier software installations. Instances can be used to ship\
          \ entire software\n configuration. The instances can be made as a image\
          \ after configuration, and\n then other users can use the image to launch\
          \ new virtual machines. \n \n \n testing and disaster recovery. Once installed,\
          \ a virtual machine can be\n consider as a \"container\" (snapshot) that\
          \ can be arbitrarily frozen, woken up, copied,\n backed up and, transported\
          \ between hosts.  \n \n \n infrastructure consolidation. Virtual machines\
          \ can significantly\n reduce hardware and electricity costs. \n \n \n Some\
          \ terminology \n It is helpful to understand some crucial terminology, especially\
          \ the following\nterms: \n \n \n host: This is the computer system where\
          \ your virtual machine is running on top\n of it. \n \n \n guest operation\
          \ system: This is the operation system that is running inside\n the virtual\
          \ machine. \n \n \n virtual machine image: a single file which contains\
          \ a virtual disk that has\n bootable operation system installed on it. \
          \ \n \n \n Target audience \n This guide aims to provide more detailed information\
          \ to advanced users who might\nact as system administrator to manage instances\

          \ gives a brief explanation about them: \n \n \n Create Snapshot, create\
          \ a snapshot of instance. The snapshot will save all the\n state of instance\
          \ at the time you taking the snapshot and it can be used an\n image to launch\

          \ this action allows users to reboot the running instance. \n \n \n Hard\
          \ Reboot Instance, this action allows users to reboot the running instance.\n\
          \ The difference between soft reboot and hard reboot are that soft reboot\
          \ issues\n reboot signal to the running instance and will do a smooth reboot\
          \ and the hard\n reboot simulates the reboot like pressing the computer\
          \ power button. It is useful\n if the running instance is not responding\
          \ to any commands. \n \n \n Rebuild Instance, use different image to build\
          \ a new instance. The new instance\n maintains the same specification of\
          \ the old instance such as cpus, rams and etc.\n Remember, this action will\
          \ destroy all data in the instance and need to use with\n caution. \n \n\
          \ \n Terminate Instance, permanently delete the instance and data is removed\
          \ as well. \n \n \n You can refer to this document to see more information\
          \ about\nmanaging instances. \n Create instance snapshots \n To create an\
          \ snapshot, you can click 'Create Snapshot' from the above action list\n\
          and you will see a pop-up window like below: \n \n Provide a meaningful\
          \ name and the click 'Create Snapshot' button. \n Notes: You should always\
          \ pause the instance before snapshot it. However, live\nsnapshot is also\
          \ possible and you need to make sure the snapshot is consistent\nwith the\
          \ instance as the snapshot doesn't capture the state of the memory. So\n\
          before snapshot, you need to ensure that: \n \n \n running programs have\
          \ written their contenst to disk \n \n \n the file system does not have\
          \ any 'dirty' buffers \n \n \n For Linux user, you can execute sync to write\
          \ dirty buffer to disk.\nIt is not sufficient to only use sync to get file\
          \ system consistent. It is\nrecommend to use fsfreeze tool. In ubuntu, you\
          \ can run sudo apt-get install util-linux\nto install the fsfreeze tool.\
          \ \n To freeze a file system, you can run fsfreeze -f /mnt as a root user\n\
          in a command line console, where /mnt is the file system mount point. \n\
          \ After you created the snapshot, you can unfreeze the file system by executing\
          \ fsfreeze -u /mnt\nwhere /mnt is the file system mount point. \n You can\
          \ refer to Taking Snapshot for more information. \n Change security group\
          \ \n You can click \"Edit Security groups\" from the drop down list to add/remove\n\
          security group for a running instance. \n \n From the above screenshot,\
          \ You can see the currently applied security groups are\nlisted on the right\
          \ hand side and left hand side is a list of available security\ngroups.\
          \ You can click the plus button to add the available security groups\nto\
          \ the right hand side and click the minus button to remove a security group.\n\
          Once you have done, you can click 'Save' button to save your changes.  \n\
          \ Launch a VNC console \n Sometimes, you need to access your instance directly\
          \ via a web browser and you\ncan do it by using the VNC console. The console\
          \ provides a great way to access\nthe instance if you haven't open port\
          \ for SSH. \n Click the \"console\" item from the drop down list and you\
          \ should see a screenshot\nlike below: \n \n You can then click the 'Click\
          \ here to show only console' and you should see the\nbelow screenshot: \n\
          \ \n After the login prompt appears, you can type in username and password\
          \ to login\nto the instance and perform any task as required. \n View log\
          \ \n The console log provides very useful information that may be required\
          \ in\ntroubleshooting issues. You can access the log by clicking \"view\

    <li>\n<p>Click 'Instances' on the left side of the page and click 'Action' drop\
    \ down\n list for an instance. You should see something similar as the below screenshot</p>\n\

    ></p>\n<p>The drop down list includes all the available actions you can use to\
    \ manage the\ninstance. The below gives a brief explanation about them:</p>\n\
    <ul>\n<li>\n<p>Create Snapshot, create a snapshot of instance. The snapshot will\
    \ save all the\n state of instance at the time you taking the snapshot and it\
    \ can be used an\n image to launch a new instance with all the saved state. Only\
    \ primary disk is\n saved.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Edit instance, change the name\
    \ of the instance.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Edit Security Groups, you can add/delete\
    \ security groups associated with the\n instance. This allows your open/close\
    \ ports after instance has been launched.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Console, this action\
    \ allows you to access the instance via the VNC console and\n allow your to access\
    \ the instance via the web browser.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>View Log, this action\
    \ allows you view the boot messages that normally displayed\n on the standard\
    \ output (monitor). This is useful for debugging.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Pause Instance,\
    \ this action temporarily pauses the state of a running instance,\n it is useful\
    \ for taking a snapshot.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Suspend Instance, this action stops\
    \ a running instance. The difference between\n pause and suspend is that pause\
    \ is only for a shot period, all resources binded\n to an instance are still available\
    \ and suspend is for long-term and resources may\n be removed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\
    <p>Soft Reboot Instance, this action allows users to reboot the running instance.</p>\n\
    </li>\n<li>\n<p>Hard Reboot Instance, this action allows users to reboot the running\
    \ instance.\n The difference between soft reboot and hard reboot are that soft\
    \ reboot issues\n reboot signal to the running instance and will do a smooth reboot\
    \ and the hard\n reboot simulates the reboot like pressing the computer power\
    \ button. It is useful\n if the running instance is not responding to any commands.</p>\n\
    </li>\n<li>\n<p>Rebuild Instance, use different image to build a new instance.\
    \ The new instance\n maintains the same specification of the old instance such\
    \ as cpus, rams and etc.\n Remember, this action will destroy all data in the\
    \ instance and need to use with\n caution.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Terminate Instance,\
    \ permanently delete the instance and data is removed as well.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\
    <p>You can refer to this <a href=\"http://docs.openstack.org/user-guide/dashboard_launch_instances.html\"\
    >document</a> to see more information about\nmanaging instances.</p>\n<h3>Create\
    \ instance snapshots</h3>\n<p>To create an snapshot, you can click 'Create Snapshot'\
    \ from the above action list\nand you will see a pop-up window like below:</p>\n\
    <p><img alt=\"snapshot\" src=\"https://github.com/NeCTAR-RC/nectarcloud-tier0doco/blob/master/articles/Cloud\
    \ Expert--DOCID19/Instance Management--DOCID39/images/snapshot.png?raw=true\"\
    ></p>\n<p>Provide a meaningful name and the click 'Create Snapshot' button.</p>\n\
    <p>Notes: You should always pause the instance before snapshot it. However, live\n\
    snapshot is also possible and you need to make sure the snapshot is consistent\n\
    with the instance as the snapshot doesn't capture the state of the memory. So\n\
    before snapshot, you need to ensure that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>running programs\
    \ have written their contenst to disk</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the file system does\
    \ not have any 'dirty' buffers</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For Linux user, you can execute\
    \ <code>sync</code> to write dirty buffer to disk.\nIt is not sufficient to only\
    \ use sync to get file system consistent. It is\nrecommend to use fsfreeze tool.\
    \ In ubuntu, you can run <code>sudo apt-get install util-linux</code>\nto install\
    \ the fsfreeze tool.</p>\n<p>To freeze a file system, you can run <code>fsfreeze\
    \ -f /mnt</code> as a root user\nin a command line console, where /mnt is the\
    \ file system mount point.</p>\n<p>After you created the snapshot, you can unfreeze\
    \ the file system by executing <code>fsfreeze -u /mnt</code>\nwhere /mnt is the\
    \ file system mount point.</p>\n<p>You can refer to <a href=\"http://docs.openstack.org/openstack-ops/content/snapshots.html\"\
    >Taking Snapshot</a> for more information.</p>\n<h3>Change security group</h3>\n\
    <p>You can click \"Edit Security groups\" from the drop down list to add/remove\n\
    security group for a running instance.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"instance management\"\
    \ src=\"https://github.com/NeCTAR-RC/nectarcloud-tier0doco/blob/master/articles/Cloud\
    \ Expert--DOCID19/Instance Management--DOCID39/images/security_group.png?raw=true\"\
    ></p>\n<p>From the above screenshot, You can see the currently applied security\
    \ groups are\nlisted on the right hand side and left hand side is a list of available\
    \ security\ngroups. You can click the plus button to add the available security\
    \ groups\nto the right hand side and click the minus button to remove a security\
    \ group.\nOnce you have done, you can click 'Save' button to save your changes.\
    \ </p>\n<h3>Launch a VNC console</h3>\n<p>Sometimes, you need to access your instance\
    \ directly via a web browser and you\ncan do it by using the VNC console. The\
    \ console provides a great way to access\nthe instance if you haven't open port\
    \ for SSH.</p>\n<p>Click the \"console\" item from the drop down list and you\
    \ should see a screenshot\nlike below:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"instance management\"\
    \ src=\"https://github.com/NeCTAR-RC/nectarcloud-tier0doco/blob/master/articles/Cloud\
    \ Expert--DOCID19/Instance Management--DOCID39/images/console1.png?raw=true\"\
    ></p>\n<p>You can then click the 'Click here to show only console' and you should\
    \ see the\nbelow screenshot:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"instance management\" src=\"https://github.com/NeCTAR-RC/nectarcloud-tier0doco/blob/master/articles/Cloud\
    \ Expert--DOCID19/Instance Management--DOCID39/images/console2.png?raw=true\"\
    ></p>\n<p>After the login prompt appears, you can type in username and password\
    \ to login\nto the instance and perform any task as required.</p>\n<h3>View log</h3>\n\
    <p>The console log provides very useful information that may be required in\n\
    troubleshooting issues. You can access the log by clicking \"view log\" item from\n\
    the action drop down list. After clicking, you should see the below screenshot:</p>\n\
    <p><img alt=\"instance management\" src=\"https://github.com/NeCTAR-RC/nectarcloud-tier0doco/blob/master/articles/Cloud\

    <p>This gives you the latest system log messages, if you want to see the full\
    \ logs,\nyou can click the 'View Full Log Button'.</p>\n<h3>create and manage\
    \ volumes</h3>\n<p>You can attach volumes as persistent storage to instances.\
    \ You can attach or\ndetach a volume from a instance at any time and it is also\
    \ easy to create snapshot\nfrom or delete a volume.</p>\n<p>To create a volume,\
    \ you can follow the below steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Log in to the <a href=\"\

        desc_un_html: " Manage instance via API \n The NeCTAR Dashboard is one way\
          \ to manage your instances in projects and NeCTAR\ncloud provides instance\
          \ management via API. There are two types of API you can use\nto manage\
          \ your instance, one is Nova command line API and another is Nova python\n\
          API. Which one to use depends on your needs. The Nova python API is great\
          \ if you\nwant integrate it with python programming to manage instance in\
          \ a programmatic way.\nIf you are a system administrator and you probably\
          \ will prefer to sue Nova command\nline API through a console to manage\
          \ instances. Both of them provides more\nmanagement options than you can\
          \ do through the Dashboard.  \n Installation \n You can use pip to install\
          \ the python-nova API and the nova command line API. \n See below for the\
          \ instructions: \n OS X \n sudo easy_install pip\nsudo pip install --upgrade\
          \ setuptools\nsudo pip install python-novaclient \n Ubuntu \n ```\nsudo\
          \ aptitude install python-pip\nsudo pip install python-novaclient \n ```\
          \ \n RHEL, CentOS, or Fedora \n sudo yum install python-setuptools\nsudo\
          \ easy_install pip\nsudo pip install --upgrade setuptools\nsudo pip install\
          \ python-novaclient \n Windows \n See pip windows for instructions on installing\
          \ pip for Windows. \n pip install python-novaclient \n Configuration \n\
          \ Before you can use the python nova client and command line API you need\
          \ to be\nauthenticated to the NeCTAR cloud. The below shows the instructions\
          \ of how to\nget username/password and get authenticated. \n \n \n Login\
          \ to NeCTAR Cloud Dashboard \n \n \n Click the drop down list beside the\
          \ top left nectar logo to select a project \n \n \n Click 'Access & Security'\
          \ \n \n \n On the 'Access & Security' page, click tab 'API Access' \n \n\
          \ \n Click button \"Download OpenStack RC File\" \n \n \n Save the file\
          \ into a directory \n \n \n Click the drop down list with your email on\
          \ the right top of page, then click\n Settings \n \n \n Click 'Reset Password'\
          \ and save the password appeared on the screen \n \n \n Nova API normally\
          \ requires 4 environment variables to be set for authentication: \n \n auth\
          \ URL \n username \n project id or name (most clients can handle either)\
          \ \n password \n \n When using the script file you downloaded from NeCTAR\
          \ Dashboard, these\nvariables are set by the script file and you can see\
          \ these variables\nif you open the file. Example: \n OS_AUTH_URL: https://keystone.rc.nectar.org.au:5000/v2.0/\n\
          OS_TENANT_NAME=my_science_project\nOS_TENANT_ID=sdfsdfsfwrwewer\nOS_USERNAME=clouduser@example.edu.au\n\
          OS_PASSWORD=XXXXXX \n Authentication for Command Line API \n The below instruction\
          \ assumes you use Linux operating system. \n Once you have obtained the\
          \ authentication script and password, you can execute\nthe script using\
          \ source file-name.sh. and type in the password you\nobtained from Dashboard.\
          \ \n Authentication for python swift API \n You can use the below sample\
          \ code to get authenticated.  \n ``` \n from novaclient import client\n\
          nova = client.Client(VERSION, USERNAME, PASSWORD, PROJECT_NAME, AUTH_URL)\
          \ \n ``` \n The VERSION parameter can be \"1.1\" or \"2\". You can get USERNAME,\
          \ PROJECT_NAME and\nAUTH_URL from the above .sh file obtained from the NeCTAR\
          \ Dashboard and you can\nalso get the PASSWORD from above as copied from\
          \ the NeCTAR Dashboard. \n Nova Command Line API \n you can use nova command\
          \ to manage your instances in a selected project, you can\ntype nova --help\
          \ or just nova to find out all the available\noptions and sub commands.\
          \ \n If you want to know more about a specific sub command,\nexecute nova\
          \ help command-name for help.  \n To list all active instances, execute\
          \ nova list. This should return\nall available instances in one project.\
          \ \n To list all available flavors, execute nova flavor-list. \n To list\
          \ all available images, execute nova image-list. \n To list all available\
          \ security groups, execute nova secgroup-list. \n To list all available\
          \ key pairs, execute nova keypair-list. \n To list all available availability\
          \ zones, execute nova availability-zone-list. \n Note: not all options are\
          \ available as there is a security policy applied and\nyour account might\
          \ not have sufficient permission.  \n The below shows how to create/delete,\
          \ change state of a instance: \n To boot a new instance, you need to get\
          \ image name, keypair name, security group\nname and flavor name. You can\
          \ use the above mentioned commands to acquire these\ninformation. Then,\
          \ you can use nova boot command to launch a new instance, the\nformat is:\
          \ \n ``` \n nova boot [instance-name]  --flavor [name] --image [name] --key-name\
          \ [name]\n--security-groups [names separated by space] \n ``` \n You can\
          \ also specify option --availability-zone to launch an instance in a\ndesigned\
          \ zone and option --user-data  for a initialization script\nused only for\
          \ the first time when instance boots. The user data script can be\nput in\
          \ a file and then passed to instance creation. You can see check this\n\
          website to see what script you can use to initialize an instance.  \n To\
          \ get more help, you can execute nova help boot to see what other\noptions\
          \ are available. \n To boot a stopped instance, use nova start . \n To stop\
          \ an instance, use nova stop . \n To suspend an instance ,use nova suspend\
          \ . \n To show details of an instance, use nova show . \n To resume an instance,\
          \ use nova resume . \n To create a snapshot of a instance, use nova image-create\
          \ \n. \n You can also find more information about nova command line API\
          \ via\nnovaclient. \n Nova Python API \n You can also use Nova Python API\
          \ to manage instances integrated with Python\nprogramming language. \n The\
          \ below shows an sample code to launch a new instance and you need to get\n\
          authentication information first from above: \n ``` \n from novaclient import\
          \ client\nnova = client.Client(\"2\", username, password, project_name,\
          \ auth_url) \n nova.servers.list()\nnova.flavors.list()\nnova.keypairs.list()\n\
          nova.images.list()\nnova.security_groups.list() \n server_name = 'new instance'\n\
          image = 'NeCTAR Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty) amd64'\nflavor = 'm1.small'\nsecurity_groups\
          \ = ['5c8c4dd0-db53-41e3-a53b-9730c764149c', '8cca1fba-b6b2-4ba3-b58e-b568f01e73ff']\n\
          key_name = 'ming' \n nova.servers.create(server_name, image, flavor, security_groups=security_groups,\
          \ key_name=) \n ```  \n You can find more information about nova python\
          \ API from this link "

  html: "<h2>Manage instance via API</h2>\n<p>The NeCTAR Dashboard is one way to manage\
    \ your instances in projects and NeCTAR\ncloud provides instance management via\
    \ API. There are two types of API you can use\nto manage your instance, one is\
    \ Nova command line API and another is Nova python\nAPI. Which one to use depends\
    \ on your needs. The Nova python API is great if you\nwant integrate it with python\
    \ programming to manage instance in a programmatic way.\nIf you are a system administrator\
    \ and you probably will prefer to sue Nova command\nline API through a console\
    \ to manage instances. Both of them provides more\nmanagement options than you\
    \ can do through the Dashboard. </p>\n<h2>Installation</h2>\n<p>You can use pip\
    \ to install the python-nova API and the nova command line API.</p>\n<p>See below\
    \ for the instructions:</p>\n<p>OS X</p>\n<p><code>sudo easy_install pip\nsudo\
    \ pip install --upgrade setuptools\nsudo pip install python-novaclient</code></p>\n\
    <p>Ubuntu</p>\n<p>```\nsudo aptitude install python-pip\nsudo pip install python-novaclient</p>\n\
    <p>```</p>\n<p>RHEL, CentOS, or Fedora</p>\n<p><code>sudo yum install python-setuptools\n\
    sudo easy_install pip\nsudo pip install --upgrade setuptools\nsudo pip install\
    \ python-novaclient</code></p>\n<p>Windows</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/win/\"\
    >pip windows</a> for instructions on installing pip for Windows.</p>\n<p><code>pip\
    \ install python-novaclient</code></p>\n<h2>Configuration</h2>\n<p>Before you\
    \ can use the python nova client and command line API you need to be\nauthenticated\
    \ to the NeCTAR cloud. The below shows the instructions of how to\nget username/password\
    \ and get authenticated.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Login to NeCTAR Cloud <a href=\"\
    https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au\">Dashboard</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click\

    \ \"Download OpenStack RC File\"</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Save the file into a directory</p>\n\
    </li>\n<li>\n<p>Click the drop down list with your email on the right top of page,\
    \ then click\n Settings</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click 'Reset Password' and save the\
    \ password appeared on the screen</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Nova API normally requires\
    \ 4 environment variables to be set for authentication:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>auth URL</li>\n\
    <li>username</li>\n<li>project id or name (most clients can handle either)</li>\n\
    <li>password</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When using the script file you downloaded from NeCTAR\
    \ Dashboard, these\nvariables are set by the script file and you can see these\
    \ variables\nif you open the file. Example:</p>\n<p>OS_AUTH_URL: https://keystone.rc.nectar.org.au:5000/v2.0/\n\
    OS_TENANT_NAME=my_science_project\nOS_TENANT_ID=sdfsdfsfwrwewer\nOS_USERNAME=clouduser@example.edu.au\n\
    OS_PASSWORD=XXXXXX</p>\n<h3>Authentication for Command Line API</h3>\n<p>The below\
    \ instruction assumes you use Linux operating system.</p>\n<p>Once you have obtained\
    \ the authentication script and password, you can execute\nthe script using <code>source\
    \ file-name.sh</code>. and type in the password you\nobtained from Dashboard.</p>\n\
    <h3>Authentication for python swift API</h3>\n<p>You can use the below sample\

          \ other operating systems, the debugging process might be\na slightly different,\
          \ however, the general rules should still apply. \n Nova command line client\
          \ is very much like other Linux commands, it outputs\nerrors in the standard\
          \ output, which is the monitor. \n If you get an error, you can always read\
          \ the error message and generally it give\nyou very good hints about what\
          \ might be wrong. \n For example, if you execute nova service-list on the\
          \ command line without\nauthentication, the error message might look like\
          \ this: \n ```\nERROR: You must provide a username via either --os-username\
          \ or env[OS_USERNAME] \n ``` \n The above message indicates you need to\
          \ be authenticated before you can use the\nAPI. The authentication requires\
          \ some environment variables to be set. To set\nthese environment variables\
          \ you can either source the script file obtained from\nNeCTAR Dashboard\

          \ to learn each supported options. \n If you find a useful command, you\
          \ can also execute nova help command,\nthis will give your more specific\
          \ help for the command. \n Debugging Nova Python API \n Debugging Nova Python\
          \ API takes more effects as it depends on how familiar\nwith Python programming\
          \ and what development environment you use. \n The below provides some basic\
          \ information about how you debug the Nova Python\nAPI. \n You can debug\
          \ your python code using Python debugger called pdb and you can find\nmore\
          \ information here. \n The below code uses pdb debuuger to debug a python\
          \ file contains clinet python\nAPI code. \n pdb file_name.py \n Once you\
          \ executed the above code, the command line will be stopped on the first\n\
          line of code and you can use some commands to control the execution flow.\
          \ \n Some useful ones to use are: \n \n \n b: set a breakpoint \n \n \n\
          \ c: continue debugging until you hit a breakpoint \n \n \n s: step through\
          \ the code \n \n \n n: to go to next line of code \n \n \n l: list source\
          \ code for the current file \n \n \n u : navigate up a stack frame \n \n\
          \ \n d: navigate down a stack frame \n \n \n p: to print the value of an\
          \ expression in the current context \n \n \n Debugging Via HTTP \n The both\
          \ of command line API and python API are restful web service client.\nThus\
          \ the requests are all made by using HTTP and you can always refer to\n\
          OpenStack Service End for further references about what should be\npresented\
          \ in the HTTP requests. The Nova API uses requests library\nto send and\
          \ receive HTTP requests/responses. \n For command line client, you can add\
          \ --debug option to print out HTTP request\nheader and HTTP response header,\
          \ which give you a lot of more insight\ninformation. To verify parameters\
          \ in the request header, you can refer to\nOpenStack service {API]api to\
          \ see what are expected. \n To enable debugging information on the standard\
          \ out for Python API, you can add\nthe below code: \n ```\nimport logging\n\
          logger = logging.getLogger(\"novaclient\")\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)\
          \ \n ``` \n The will print the same output as adding --debug option for\
          \ command line API. \n Debugging via Source Code \n If the above techniques\
          \ are still not helpful, you can always look at the source\ncode to find\
          \ the problems. \n The below source file structure is based on the installation\
          \ in Ubuntu. \n The command line nova command is located in /usr/bin/nova.\
          \ By looking at this\nfile, you should get a idea of how the various options\
          \ are interpreted. This file\nacts as an interface for Python API. \n The\
          \ Python API files are located under\n/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/novaclient\
          \ and the most important file to look\nat is client.py. This file does all\
          \ the request preparation, sending request and\nreceiving response. It is\
          \ also used by the command line Nova client.  "

          <h2>Debugging Via HTTP</h2>

          <p>The both of command line API and python API are restful web service client.

          Thus the requests are all made by using HTTP and you can always refer to

          <a href="http://developer.openstack.org/api-ref-objectstorage-v1.html">OpenStack
          Service End</a> for further references about what should be

          presented in the HTTP requests. The Nova API uses <a href="http://www.python-requests.org/en/latest/">requests</a>
          library

          to send and receive HTTP requests/responses.</p>

          <p>For command line client, you can add --debug option to print out HTTP
          request

          header and HTTP response header, which give you a lot of more insight

          information. To verify parameters in the request header, you can refer to

          OpenStack service {API]<a href="http://developer.openstack.org/api-ref-objectstorage-v1.html">api</a>
          to see what are expected.</p>

          <p>To enable debugging information on the standard out for Python API, you
          can add

          the below code:</p>

          <p>```

          import logging

          logger = logging.getLogger("novaclient")

          logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)</p>

          <p>```</p>

          <p>The will print the same output as adding --debug option for command line
          API.</p>

          <h2>Debugging via Source Code</h2>

          <p>If the above techniques are still not helpful, you can always look at
          the source

          code to find the problems.</p>

          <p>The below source file structure is based on the installation in Ubuntu.</p>

          <p>The command line nova command is located in /usr/bin/nova. By looking
          at this

          file, you should get a idea of how the various options are interpreted.

          <p>The Python API files are located under

  html: '<h2>Debugging Nova Command line Client</h2>

    <p>The below assumes you have installed Nova command client in a Linux

    environment. If you have other operating systems, the debugging process might
    be

    a slightly different, however, the general rules should still apply.</p>

    <p>Nova command line client is very much like other Linux commands, it outputs

    errors in the standard output, which is the monitor.</p>

    <p>If you get an error, you can always read the error message and generally it
    give

    you very good hints about what might be wrong.</p>

    <p>For example, if you execute <code>nova service-list</code> on the command line
    without

    authentication, the error message might look like this:</p>

    <p>```

    ERROR: You must provide a username via either --os-username or env[OS_USERNAME]</p>

    <p>```</p>

    <p>The above message indicates you need to be authenticated before you can use
    the

    API. The authentication requires some environment variables to be set. To set

    these environment variables you can either source the script file obtained from

    NeCTAR <a href="https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au">Dashboard</a> or you can override
    it by using command line options.</p>

    <p>You can always execute <code>man nova`` or simply</code>nova``` to get more
    help

    information and to learn each supported options.</p>

    <p>If you find a useful command, you can also execute <code>nova help command</code>,

    this will give your more specific help for the command.</p>

    <h2>Debugging Nova Python API</h2>

    <p>Debugging Nova Python API takes more effects as it depends on how familiar

    with Python programming and what development environment you use.</p>

    <p>The below provides some basic information about how you debug the Nova Python

    API.</p>

    <p>You can debug your python code using Python debugger called pdb and you can
    find

    more information <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/pdb.html">here</a>.</p>

    <p>The below code uses pdb debuuger to debug a python file contains clinet python

    API code.</p>

    <p><code>pdb file_name.py</code></p>

    <p>Once you executed the above code, the command line will be stopped on the first

    line of code and you can use some commands to control the execution flow.</p>

    <p>Some useful ones to use are:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>

    <p>b: set a breakpoint</p>

    </li>

    <li>

    <p>c: continue debugging until you hit a breakpoint</p>

    </li>

    <li>

    <p>s: step through the code</p>

    </li>

    <li>

    <p>n: to go to next line of code</p>

    </li>

    <li>

        desc_un_html: " Heat: the dashboard \n On the research cloud dashboard project\
          \ panel\nthere is a side menu heading named \"Orchestration\". It has a\
          \ sub menu entry\ntitled \"Stacks\": \n \n When you select it you will see\
          \ a list of the stacks that you have created, and\nto the top right, a button\
          \ pair, one labelled \"+ Launch Stack\", the other\n\"\u2716 Delete Stack\"\
          : \n \n Pressing the \"+ Launch Stack\" button creates a dialogue that invites\
          \ you to\nprovide a Heat template. \n \n The dialogue offers you three ways\
          \ of providing a template via the \"Template Source\"\ndrop down: \n \n\
          \ \nURL - The template can be reached via a web browser, and you are going\
          \ to\n  provide the URL it can be found at; \n \nFile - You are going to\
          \ upload the template from your local machine; \n \nDirect Input - You will\
          \ type the template in by hand. \n \n Dependent on which selection you make\
          \ in the \"Template Source\" drop down, the\ndialogue will reconfigure itself\
          \ to allow you to provide the required information. \n The dialogue also\
          \ offers you the chance to provide an \"Environment Source\".\nThis is also\
          \ in the form of a drop down, but here the choices are limited\nto: \n \n\
          \ \nFile - You are going to upload the environment from your local machine;\
          \ \n \nDirect Input - You will type the environment in by hand. \n \n Again,\
          \ dependant on which selection you make, the dialogue will reconfigure\n\
          itself to allow you to provide the required information. \n An environment\n\
          simply allows you to provide parameter values and to define custom resources.\
          \ \n In this example we are going to use one of the NeCTAR Heat sample templates.\
          \ \n So in the Template Source field select \"URL\", then in the \"Template\
          \ URL\" field\nenter: \n https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NeCTAR-RC/heat-templates/master/juno/Fedora/wordpress_single_instance.yaml\
          \ \n Then in the Environment Source field select \"Direct Input\", then\
          \ in the environment\ndata edit box type the following yaml (taking care\
          \ to enter the correct values): \n yaml\nparameters:\n  # your nectar keypair\
          \ name instead of 'nectar_demo'\n  key_name: nectar_demo\n  # the latest\
          \ nectar fedora image id\n  fedora_image_id: db354243-aba2-4831-81c7-a155b9089291\
          \ \n Once you are done press the \"Next\" button. \n All going well, you\
          \ should now be presented with a page titled \"Launch Stack\".\nIt will\
          \ be a form that is made up of fields that are taken from your template's\n\
          parameters. \n Next to each field is a small question mark icon. As it gains\
          \ focus, so the user\nwill be shows the parameters comment field as a help\
          \ bubble to the right. \n \n The value entered into the \"Stack Name\" field\
          \ is used to give a name to the stack\nthat is going to be launched by Heat.\
          \ This name must start with a letter and may\nonly contain letters, numbers,\
          \ underscores, full stops and hyphens... \n The \"Creation Timeout (minutes)\"\
          \ field is the number of minutes that should be\nallowed for the stack creation\
          \ to take. If this time is exceeded then the stack\ncreation will be aborted.\
          \ \n The \"Rollback On Failure\" field, if checked, will ensure that the\
          \ complete\nstack gets deleted if there is a failure in creation. If it's\
          \ not checked then\nyou will have to manually delete the stack should there\
          \ be a failure in the creation. \n The rest of the fields are taken from\
          \ the template that has been uploaded.\nYou should find that the values\
          \ you entered in the environment file\nhave been used to fill the fields.\
          \ Otherwise, simply provide the requested\nvalues then select the \"Launch\"\
          \ button. \n All going well, the stack should be created. Once created you\
          \ can select it\nin the lists of stacks that are active, drilling down into\
          \ its\nparticular details. \n When you are finished with a stack, you can\
          \ simply hit the \"Delete\" button\nnext to it on the stack listings. If\
          \ you want to delete more than one\nstack, select the checkboxes next to\
          \ them and hit the \"\u2716 Delete Stack\"\nbutton. "

          \ NeCTAR Heat sample templates.</p>\n<p>So in the Template Source field\
          \ select \"URL\", then in the \"Template URL\" field\nenter:</p>\n<p><a\
          \ href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NeCTAR-RC/heat-templates/master/juno/Fedora/wordpress_single_instance.yaml\"\

          <p>Once you are done press the \"Next\" button.</p>\n<p>All going well,\
          \ you should now be presented with a page titled \"Launch Stack\".\nIt will\

          <p>The \"Rollback On Failure\" field, if checked, will ensure that the complete\n\

          \ other operating systems, the debugging process might be\na slightly different,\
          \ however, the general rules should still apply. \n Swift command line client\
          \ is very much like other Linux commands, it outputs\nerrors in the standard\
          \ output, which is the monitor. \n If you get an error, you can always read\
          \ the error message and generally it give\nyou very good hints about what\
          \ might be wrong. \n For example, if you execute swift list on the command\
          \ line without\nauthentication, the error message might look like this:\
          \ \n ```\nAuth version 1.0 requires ST_AUTH, ST_USER, and ST_KEY environment\
          \ variables\nto be set or overridden with -A, -U, or -K. \n Auth version\
          \ 2.0 requires OS_AUTH_URL, OS_USERNAME, OS_PASSWORD, and\nOS_TENANT_NAME\
          \ OS_TENANT_ID to be set or overridden with --os-auth-url,\n--os-username,\
          \ --os-password, --os-tenant-name or os-tenant-id. Note:\nadding \"-V 2\"\
          \ is necessary for this.\n``` \n The above message indicates you that there\
          \ are 2 authentication versions that\nswift currently supports and each\
          \ version requires some environment variables\nto be set. To set these environment\
          \ variables you can either source the script\nfile downloaded from NeCTAR\
          \ Dashboard or you can override it by\nusing command line options. \n You\
          \ can always execute man swift`` or simplyswift``` to get more help\ninformation\
          \ and to learn each supported options. \n If you find a useful command,\
          \ you can also execute swift command --help,\nthis will give your more specific\
          \ help for the command. \n Debugging Client Python API \n Debugging client\
          \ Python API takes more effects as it depends on how familiar\nwith Python\
          \ programming and what development environment you use. \n The below provides\
          \ some basic information about how you debug the client Python\nAPI. \n\
          \ You can debug your python code using Python debugger called pdb and you\
          \ can find\nmore information here. \n The below code uses pdb debuuger to\
          \ debug a python file contains clinet python\nAPI code. \n pdb file_name.py\
          \ \n Once you executed the above code, the command line will be stopped\
          \ on the first\nline of code and you can use some commands to control the\
          \ execution flow. \n Some useful ones to use are: \n \n \n b: set a breakpoint\
          \ \n \n \n c: continue debugging until you hit a breakpoint \n \n \n s:\
          \ step through the code \n \n \n n: to go to next line of code \n \n \n\
          \ l: list source code for the current file \n \n \n u : navigate up a stack\
          \ frame \n \n \n d: navigate down a stack frame \n \n \n p: to print the\
          \ value of an expression in the current context \n \n \n Debugging Via HTTP\
          \ \n The both of command line API and python API are restful web service\
          \ client.\nThus the requests are all made by using HTTP and you can always\
          \ refer to\nOpenStack Service End for further references about what should\
          \ be\npresented in the HTTP requests. The swift API uses requests library\n\
          to send and receive HTTP requests/responses. \n For command line client,\
          \ you can add --debug option to print out HTTP request\nheader and HTTP\
          \ response header, which give you a lot of more insight\ninformation. To\
          \ verify parameters in the request header, you can refer to\nOpenStack service\
          \ {API]api to see what are expected. \n To enable debugging information\
          \ on the standard out for Python API, you can add\nthe below code: \n ```\n\
          import logging\nlogger = logging.getLogger(\"swiftclient\")\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)\
          \ \n ``` \n The will print the same output as adding --debug option for\
          \ command line API. \n Debugging via Source Code \n If the above techniques\
          \ are still not helpful, you can always look at the source\ncode to find\
          \ the problems. \n The below source file structure is based on the installation\
          \ in Ubuntu. \n The command line swift command is located in /usr/bin/swift.\

    <p><code>pdb file_name.py</code></p>

    <p>Once you executed the above code, the command line will be stopped on the first

    line of code and you can use some commands to control the execution flow.</p>

    <p>Some useful ones to use are:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>

    <p>b: set a breakpoint</p>

    </li>

    <li>

    <p>c: continue debugging until you hit a breakpoint</p>

    </li>

    <li>

    <p>s: step through the code</p>

    </li>

    <li>

    <p>n: to go to next line of code</p>

    </li>

    <li>

    <p>l: list source code for the current file</p>

    </li>

    <li>

    <p>u : navigate up a stack frame</p>

    </li>

    <li>

    <p>d: navigate down a stack frame</p>

    </li>

    <li>

    <p>p: to print the value of an expression in the current context</p>

    </li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Debugging Via HTTP</h2>

    <p>The both of command line API and python API are restful web service client.

    Thus the requests are all made by using HTTP and you can always refer to

    <a href="http://developer.openstack.org/api-ref-objectstorage-v1.html">OpenStack
    Service End</a> for further references about what should be

    presented in the HTTP requests. The swift API uses <a href="http://www.python-requests.org/en/latest/">requests</a>
    library

    to send and receive HTTP requests/responses.</p>

    <p>For command line client, you can add --debug option to print out HTTP request

    header and HTTP response header, which give you a lot of more insight

    information. To verify parameters in the request header, you can refer to

    OpenStack service {API]<a href="http://developer.openstack.org/api-ref-objectstorage-v1.html">api</a>
    to see what are expected.</p>

    <p>To enable debugging information on the standard out for Python API, you can
    add

    the below code:</p>

    <p>```

    import logging

    logger = logging.getLogger("swiftclient")

    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)</p>

    <p>```</p>

    <p>The will print the same output as adding --debug option for command line API.</p>

    <h2>Debugging via Source Code</h2>

    <p>If the above techniques are still not helpful, you can always look at the source

    code to find the problems.</p>

    <p>The below source file structure is based on the installation in Ubuntu.</p>

    <p>The command line swift command is located in /usr/bin/swift. By looking at
    this

    file, you should get a idea of how the various options are interpreted. This file

    acts as an interface for Python API.</p>

    <p>The Python API files are located under

    /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/swiftclient and the most important file to look

    at is client.py. This is file does all the request preparation, sending request

    and receiving response. It is also used by the command line swift client. </p>'
