33: {html: "<p>This guide describes launching a running instance (virtual machine)\
    \ with SSH login\nenabled.</p>\n<h2>Preparation</h2>\n<p>You need to create a\
    \ public/private key pair before you can use SSH to login to \nthe newly created\
    \ instance. The public key will be inserted into the instance and\nthe private\
    \ key is used on your desktop/laptop.</p>\n<h3>Windows User</h3>\n<p>Use PuTTYgen\
    \ key generator to generate the required key pair.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Download\
    \ PuTTYgen (<code>puttygen.exe</code>) from <a href=\"http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html\"\
    >PuTTYgen download page</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Launch the PuTTYgen application\
    \ by double clicking the <code>puttygen.exe</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The default\
    \ settings are fine for this case, click the 'Generate' button</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\
    <p>Save your public key by clicking 'Save public key' button. You should give\
    \ a\n name that will help identify the key in the future</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Save\
    \ your private key by clicking 'Save private key' button. You should give\n a\
    \ sensible name for future reference. The passphrase can provide additional\n\
    \ security, though can be left empty.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Linux/Mac User</h3>\n\
    <p>Type <code>ssh-keygen</code> in the terminal and enter. This generates a public\
    \ key\n(<code>id_rsa.pub</code>) and a private key (<code>id_rsa</code>). By default,\
    \ the two keys are\nlocated in <code>~/.ssh</code></p>\n<h3>Import Public Key</h3>\n\
    <p>The public key generated by Windows/Linux/Mac are required to be imported into\n\
    the Nectar Cloud dashboard before use.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Log into the <a href=\"\
    https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au\">Cloud Dashboard</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Go\
    \ to the Access and Security tab and then to the Keypairs page</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\
    <p>Click 'Import Key Pair' button</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Type in a keypair name\
    \ and paste the contents of the public key. For Windows\n users, open PuTTYgen\
    \ and click 'Load' button to load the related private key and\n copy/paste the\
    \ public key contents. For Linux/Mac user, type\n cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub and copy/paste\
    \ the public key contents from the terminal\n output</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Nectar\
    \ Cloud Dashboard</h3>\n<p>Key pairs can also be created directly through the\
    \ Nectar Cloud Dashboard.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Login to the <a href=\"https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au\"\
    >Cloud Dashboard</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Go to the Access and Security tab and\
    \ then to the Keypairs page</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click the 'Create Key Pair' button</p>\n\
    </li>\n<li>\n<p>Type in a keypair name in the popup window and click the 'Create\
    \ Key Pair'\n button</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Save the private key into a directory</p>\n\
    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Notes: If you are running a Windows machine the SSH private key\
    \ will need to be\nconverted (use PuTTYgen for converting keys)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n\
    <p>Open PuTTYgen</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click 'Load' button to load the private\

    \ save</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Select an Image</h2>\n<p>You need to select an image\
    \ to be used for your instance. The image defines what\noperating system the instance\
    \ uses and thus you need to select an image based on\nyour needs. Nectar Cloud\
    \ offers a list of official images and for\nsimplicity, these images are recommended.\
    \ You can find a complete list of\nofficial images from <a href=\"https://wiki.rc.nectar.org.au/wiki/Image_Catalog\"\
    >Nectar image catalog</a>. You can also find all\navailable images from the <a\

    <p>Before you can launch an instance, you need to configure the below options:</p>\n\
    <h3>Details</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Instance Name: the name used by the dashboard\
    \ to identify the instance</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Flavour: the resources available\
    \ for the instance. It specifies the number of\n VCPUs, size of root disk, size\
    \ of ephemeral disk and size of RAM.\n Your allocated flavour or lesser configurations\
    \ can be selected (the\n default is m2.tiny; a 1 VCPU machine)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\
    <p>Instance Count: number of instance to launch (the default is 1)</p>\n</li>\n\
    <li>\n<p>Instance Boot Source: the media used to boot the instance. You can boot\
    \ from\n image, snapshot and volume (the default is boot from image)</p>\n</li>\n\
    <li>\n<p>Boot from image: Boot instance using an image</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Boot\
    \ from snapshot: Boot instance using a snapshot</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Boot from\
    \ volume: Boot instance from volume storage</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Image Name: the\
    \ name of an Image. This option is used when the Instance Boot\n Source is 'Boot\
    \ from image'</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Access &amp; Security</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n\
    <p>Key Pair: the public/private keys used to log into the instance. See above\
    \ to\n see how to create them. This can't be added or changed after the instance\
    \ is\n created.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Security Groups: add network access to your\
    \ instances. This determines what\n services can be accessed on the instance.\
    \ You must select 'SSH' Security Groups\n to allow you to login via SSH. If 'SSH'\
    \ Security Groups is not available, you\n can create it by going to Access &amp;\
    \ Security tab on the right hand side of the\n Cloud Dashboard. The default Security\
    \ Group (no network access at first) is\n pre-selected</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To\
    \ create a Security Group:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Login to the <a href=\"https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au\"\
    >Cloud Dashboard</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Go to the Access &amp; Security tab</p>\n\
    </li>\n<li>\n<p>Click 'Create Security Group' button</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Give\
    \ a name for the Security Group</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Give a meaningful description\
    \ for the Security Group</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click 'Create Security Group' button</p>\n\
    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>The newly created Security Group has no rules added (no network\
    \ access defined).\nTo add rules to a Security Group:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Go to\
    \ the Access &amp; Security tab</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tick to select the Security\
    \ Group to add rules</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click 'Manage Rules' button</p>\n</li>\n\
    <li>\n<p>Click 'Add Rule' button</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Select what type of Rule\
    \ you want to create</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Select from 'Open Port' the 'Port' option\
    \ to open one single port, or 'Port Range'\n to open a range of ports</p>\n</li>\n\
    <li>\n<p>The 'Remote' option specifies the source of the traffic to be allowed\
    \ via this\n rule. You may do so either in the form of an IP address block (CIDR)\
    \ or via a\n source group (Security Group).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click 'Add' button</p>\n\
    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can also click 'Delete Rule' button to delete a rule</p>\n\
    <h3>Availability Zone</h3>\n<p>Select the Availability Zone for your instance.\
    \ The Availability Zone is the\nlocation for your instance. By default, the system\
    \ will select an available\nlocation for you. You can also click the 'Advanced'\
    \ button to select from a\ncomplete list of available Availability Zones</p>\n\
    <h3>Post-Creation</h3>\n<p>You can execute a customization script after you launch\
    \ your instance. You can\ndo any initialization and customization to your instance\
    \ by using this and it\nis executed only once at the first boot of your instance.\
    \ You can copy/paste\nyour script by selecting 'Direct Input' or you can upload\
    \ a script file. The\nscript can be a shell script or Cloud-init script.</p>\n\
    <h3>Advanced Options</h3>\n<p>You can choose whether you automaticly or manually\
    \ create the disk partition.\nIn most cases, you shouldn't change the default.</p>\n\
    <p>Notes: The above configuration options can be set in the 'Launch Instance'\
    \ popup\nwindow. To launch the popup window, you can go to the Instances tab and\n\

    <h2>What is the Nectar Cloud</h2>

    <p><a href="http://nectar.org.au/">Nectar</a> (National eResearch Collaboration
    Tools and Resources) is an Australian Government project funded to build new infrastructure
    specifically for the needs of Australian researchers.  The Nectar Cloud provides
    supported computing infrastructure, giving researchers access to computing resources
    without the need to purchase or host their own hardware.<br>

    All Australian researchers have access to the Nectar Cloud via the <a href="http://support.rc.nectar.org.au/node/111">AAF</a>.</p>

    <p>To access the cloud all users must first login through the

    Nectar Cloud dashboard:

    <a href="https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au/">https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au/</a></p>

    <h2>Instances</h2>

    <p>Instances running inside the Research Cloud are just like real-life machines
    but

    in a remote location. The Research Cloud is used to start, copy and delete

    instances. They have an operating system (you select it from a list), network

    access (a real IP address &amp; you specify any access), and hard disk storage.

    With no hardware to maintain you can copy (Snapshot) and customise new

    machines rapidly.</p>

    <h2>Tools</h2>

    <h3>The Nectar Cloud Dashboard</h3>

    <p>The Dashboard provides a web interface to get all the basic

    Research Cloud related jobs done.</p>

    <p>Use the dashboard:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>for basic Cloud operations: (launching, duplicating &amp; terminating ) instances</li>

    <li>to get [Credentials] you can use with other [API clients]</li>

    <li>to make an allocation request for a larger ongoing share of Research Cloud
    Resources.</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>More about instances</h3>

    <p>If you are familiar with connecting to remote machines already

    the same tools and techniques apply when connecting to running

    instances. Your instance has a public IP address and, if

    configured, can be reached and controlled with any remote

    access tools you wish to use. Example SSH.</p>

    <p>More information about launching and managing instances is here</p>

    <h3>Images</h3>

    <p>Instances originate from Images and can be a plain "off the

    shelf" Operating System or include software packages and

    config changes to suit a particular purpose (eg Webserving).

    There are publicly available images in the cloud ready for

    you to use.</p>

    <p>To suit your specific purposes an instance may need some

    customisation, configuration changes or software installation.

    Its a good idea to make a copy of the instance if you wish to

    re-use its current state as a starting point for new instances.

    If you are experimenting and making changes, a copy allows you

    to return to the copied state and dispose of the experiment

    without having to undo/redo configuration changes.</p>

    <p>You can create an Image from scratch, but usually its easier

    to customise &amp; copy a running instance that is close

    to what you need.</p>

    <p>Copies of instances are called Snapshots and can be used

    like other Images to start new instances. Making a Snapshot

    is simple:</p>

    <ol>

    <li>Go to the Dashboard "Instances" tab</li>

    <li>Click "Create Snapshot" for the running instance you wish to copy.</li>

    </ol>

    <h2>Keypairs</h2>

    <p>Key Pairs enable you to communicate with your instance via

    SSH. When launching an instance you specify an existing key

    pair. The public key is injected into the running

    instance''s authorized_keys file.</p>

    <p>You can manage your keypairs through the Dashboard or via

    the nova CLI client.</p>

    <p>In the dashboard under the Access &amp; Security tab you can

    manage your keys. You have the option of:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>Importing an existing SSH key you own</li>

    <li>Creating a new SSH Key</li>

    </ul>

    <p><strong>Important:</strong> Keypairs can only be specified on instance

    creation, if you don''t specify a keypair on creation you will

    not be able to add it later.</p>

    <h2>Security groups</h2>

    <p>Incoming network access to your machines is usually required.

    Security Groups are how to add network access. If you can''t

    reach your instance by SSH to login or by browser if it

    runs a Webserver additional Security Group settings could be

    needed.</p>

    <p>[Add link to more info]</p>

    <h2>Storage in the cloud</h2>

    <p>The NeCTAR Research Cloud provides instances for research

    use. While resources like processing cores, RAM and the

    amount of storage you get are dedicated to a particular

    instance, other resources like the network and the underlying

    storage system are shared among instances. Furthermore, not

    all storage is created equal, and Research Cloud users

    have a few different types of storage available which differ

    according to performance, persistence and data safety.</p>

    <p>To find out which storage option is right for you. We need

    to write the documentation for it. [LINK]</p>', parent: 21, sha1: 3948767f7053219dd717f36be1f665be992cb195,

    will take steps to shut down and isolate it so that it doesn''t do any further

    damage to cloud infrastructure or to other users'' assets.</p>

    <p>Compromised Nectar instances are a real issue. Across the Nectar federation,
    we

    see examples at least once a month.</p>

    <h2>Apply system patches as often as possible</h2>

    <p>Keeping your system up to date is one of the simplest and most effective

    ways to secure your system against unwanted intrusion.</p>

    <p>It is easy and more practical to configure a recent Linux system to apply

    patches automatically.  Alternatively If you are applying patches by hand, we

    recommend that you do it at least once a week.</p>

    <h2>Understand the lifecycle of your Linux Distribution</h2>

    <p>Every release of a linux distribution (such as Debian Wheezy, or Ubuntu

    Precise) will have a published end of life date.  Assuming you are doing the

    right thing and applying patches regularly, once the end of life date is

    reached, the patches will no longer be available.</p>

    <p>If system patches are discontinued, you should update to a more recent version

    of the operating system.  You should treat this as a matter of urgency.</p>

    <p>It is trivially easy for a Bad Person(tm) to scan your machine and determine

    exactly which attacks your instance is vulnerable to.</p>

    <h2>Understand SSH authentication</h2>

    <p>It is undeniable that ssh key authentication is the most effective way to

    secure ssh access to your instance.  Enabling ssh password authentication may

    seem like a good idea, but doing so opens your machine to brute force password

    attacks.  Don''t underestimate the means and will of Bad People(tm) to exploit

    your instance for their nefarious purposes.</p>

    <p>Don''t share your ssh private key with anyone, ever.   Like giving machine
    guns

    to monkeys, it''s a very bad idea.</p>

    <h2>Don''t use VNC, use x2go instead</h2>

    <p>VNC is one of those longstanding ways of getting graphical access to your

    computer over a network.  While it''s well known and loved, there are in fact

    many ways to exploit VNC and there are now better ways to get to your graphical

    content.</p>

    <p>X2go is technically superior to VNC and tunnels your graphical content over

    ssh.</p>

    <h2>Terminate instances that you no longer require</h2>

    <p>In theory, you can run an instance as long as you like.  In practice, we would

    prefer you to promptly terminate any instance that are not using actively, so

    that other users can make use of the resources.</p>

    <p>Currently, there is no formal Nectar mechanism to discourage wasteful use of

    your allocation, but this is likely to change.</p>

    <h2>What should I do when I am finished with an instance</h2>

    <p>When you are finished with an Instance, you should terminate it.  Leaving an

    instance running, or in "paused" or "suspended" or "shutdown" states is tying

    down resources that other people could be using.</p>

    <p>Note that terminating an instance destroys its primary and ephemeral file

    systems.  If you want to save the primary file system (so that you can launch
    a

    new instance), snapshot the instance before you terminate it.</p>', parent: 21,

39: {html: "<p>The NeCTAR virtual machines have many resources binded with them in\
    \ order for it\nto function properly. Among these resources, storage is the fundamental\
    \ component\nfor both the virtual machine and user to save and use data. The amount\
    \ of\nstorage your virtual machine get are dedicated, but the underlying storage\n\
    system are shared. Furthermore, not all storage is created equal, and Research\n\
    Cloud users have a few different types of storage available which differ\naccording\
    \ to performance, persistence and data safety.</p>\n<h2>On Virtual Machine Storage</h2>\n\
    <p>Each virtual machine in the NeCTAR Cloud comes with a certain amount of built-in\n\
    storage and these storages are appeared as two separated hard disks\n(Root Disk\
    \ and Ephemeral Disk). These storage run off robust\nenterprise-grade storage\
    \ hardware on the back. However, both storage are not\nsuitable for long-term\
    \ persistent data as data will be lost after termination or\nrebuilt of virtual\
    \ machine.</p>\n<h3>Root Disk</h3>\n<p>This storage is used for operating system\
    \ of the virtual machine to boot it\ninto a functional state. It has a limited\
    \ 10GB in size, which is same for every\nstandard size of virtual machine (Small,\
    \ Medium, Large, Extra Large and\nExtra Extra Large). The size various for non\
    \ standard virtual machines such as\ntiny, which only has 5GB root storage.</p>\n\
    <p>Data stored on the root storage are persistent until the termination or rebuilt\n\
    of the virtual machine and are copied during the snapshot. That means, if you\n\
    reboot your virtual machine, the data remains in tact and when you take a\npoint-in-time\
    \ snapshot of your virtual machine, the entire root storage is\ncopied. As the\
    \ root storage comes with fixed size and are used by the operation\nsystem, caution\
    \ need to be taken as it should not be filled in full. The name of\nthis disk\
    \ as seen from the virtual machine is usually /dev/vda.</p>\n<h3>Ephemeral Disk</h3>\n\
    <p>This storage appears as a second hard disk in your virtual machine and are\
    \ raw\nand unformatted block device, that you can format and use as you wish.\
    \ It varies\nin size according to the size of virtual machine (from 0GB to 480GB).\
    \ For every\nCPU an standard virtual machine will get 30GB of additional ephemeral\
    \ storage.\nIt various in size for non-standard virtual machine. The name of this\
    \ device as\nseen from the instance is usually /dev/vdb and some operating systems\
    \ will\nautomatically format and mount the ephemeral disk. For example, Ubuntu\
    \ creates\nan ext3 partition and mounts it at /mnt. For operating system don't\
    \ do it\nautomatically, you can format it by executing mkfs.ext4 /dev/vdb in command\
    \ line\nand mount it by executing mount /dev/vdb /mnt. You also need to have root\n\
    permission to do that.</p>\n<p>Data stored on ephemeral disk are only persistent\
    \ until the termination or\nrebuilt of virtual machine, which are same as the\
    \ root disk. The only difference\nis data on ephemeral disk are not copied when\
    \ taking an snapshot of virtual\nmachine, which means you cannot use snapshot\
    \ to save data stored on ephemeral\ndisk.</p>\n<h4>Backup of Ephemeral Disk</h4>\n\
    <p>Data on the ephemeral disk does not get saved in a snapshot, and requires other\n\
    techniques to make a backup. Other forms of storage can be used such as the\n\
    Object Store and Volume Storage within the Research Cloud or external locations.</p>\n\
    <h2>Persistent Volume Storage</h2>\n<p>Persistent volume storage can live outside\
    \ your virtual machine. It is appears\nas block storage which can be attached\
    \ then accessed and even booted from. This\nis a storage volume that you can attach\
    \ to from within your virtual machine,\nrea and write data, detach it, and make\
    \ it available to another virtual machine.\nYour data on a persistent volume is\
    \ retained even when you terminate your\nvirtual machine. Persistent Volumes offer\
    \ a snapshot feature which can be used\nto make convenient backups (uses some\
    \ of your overall Persistent Volume quota).</p>\n<p>NOTE: Persistent Volumes are\
    \ local services and only virtual machines in the\navailability zone where the\
    \ persistent Volume has been created can access it.</p>\n<h3>How to Get Persistent\
    \ Volume Storage</h3>\n<p>By default, there are no persistent volume storage available\
    \ to your project.\nYou need to make an allocation request to apply for how many\
    \ persistent volume\nstorage you want to have for your project. Follow the below\
    \ steps to make a\nrequest:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Login to NeCTAR Cloud <a href=\"\
    https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au\">Dashboard</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Go to\
    \ Allocations and you can either click 'New Request' to make a new request\n or\
    \ 'My Requests' to amend an existing request</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Under section\
    \ 'Storage Quota', you select 'Resource' as volume, select the\n Zone you want\
    \ the storage to be and enter the GB in the 'Requested Quota'.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\
    <p>Click 'Submit' button</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note:\nIt would take a while before\
    \ your request get approved.</p>\n<h3>Create a persistent volume storage</h3>\n\
    <p>Once your request has been approved, your project should have volume storage\n\
    available. You need to create volume storage in NeCTAR Cloud Dashboard first\n\
    before you can use it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Login to NeCTAR Cloud <a href=\"https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au\"\
    >Dashboard</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Go to 'Volumes'</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click\
    \ 'Create Volume' button</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Give a Volume Name and meaningful\
    \ description</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Select a volume source, this is how volume\
    \ get built. You can select\n 'No source empty volume' to create new empty volume.\
    \ You can select 'image' to\n build a volume from a image or 'Volume' to build\
    \ a volume from existing volume</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Give size to volume in GB</p>\n\
    </li>\n<li>\n<p>Give a availability zone</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click 'Create Volume'\
    \ button</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Attach a persistent volume storage</h3>\n<p>you\
    \ can attach the volume created earlier to a running virtual machine. See the\n\
    below instruction:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Login to NeCTAR Cloud <a href=\"https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au\"\
    >Dashboard</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Go to 'Volumes'</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click\
    \ the action list of volume</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click 'Edit Attachment'</p>\n\
    </li>\n<li>\n<p>Click 'Attach to Instance' drop down list to select a virtual\
    \ machine to\n attach a volume</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click 'Attach Volume' button</p>\n\
    </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Use Persistent Volume Storage in Virtual Machine</h3>\n<p>For\
    \ a standard flavor virtual machine the persistent volume will be attached\nas\
    \ /dev/vdc.</p>\n<p>A new volume may not have a file system (depending on how\
    \ it was created) and\nyou need to create one before mounting.</p>\n<p>The exact\
    \ mount command syntax is dependent on the virtual machine' operating\nsystem\
    \ and the type of file system you require.</p>\n<p>You can use below command to\
    \ create file system on the new volume:\nsudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/vdc</p>\n<p>WARNING:\
    \ This can cause data loss if a file system already exists on the target\nVolume.</p>\n\
    <p>You can use below command to mount the volume to /mnt\nsudo mount /dev/vdc\
    \ /mnt -t auto</p>\n<p>Notes:\nVolumes must be detached before deletion.</p>\n\
    <h2>Object Storage</h2>\n<p>The NeCTAR Cloud Object Storage is not a traditional\
    \ file system, but rather a\ndistributed storage system for static data such as\
    \ virtual machine images,\nphoto storage, email storage, backups and archives.\
    \ Having no central \"brain\" or\nmaster point of control provides greater scalability,\
    \ redundancy and durability.\nWhen you put a file in the NeCTAR Cloud Object Store,\
    \ 3 copies of your data are\ndistributed to different hardware for extra data\
    \ safety and performance.</p>\n<p>Think about that dataset comprised of 2GB files\
    \ that you read in and analyse\nmany times, but in general it doesn't change.\
    \ Or the images you want to use on\nthe cloud. Those are a couple examples of\
    \ what's perfect for Object Storage.\nObjects are written to multiple hardware\
    \ devices in the data center to ensure\nintegrity, and great performance!</p>\n\
    <p>In general, the object store is great for data you write once and read many\n\
    times, but not suitable for applications like databases. It's the safest place\n\
    to put your data on the NeCTAR Research Cloud as multiple redundant copies of\n\
    your data are made, and it has great performance. You can access the objec\nstore\
    \ from anywhere on the Internet, and data from Object Storage can be\ntransferred\
    \ to and from your virtual machine with a variety of http-capable\ntools.</p>\n\
    <p>Object Storage is completely decoupled from your virtual machine, so even if\
    \ you\nreboot, delete or crash your virtual machine, your Object Storage files\
    \ will\nremain safe (unless you remove them yourself). Object Storage persists\n\
    independently from the life of an instance.</p>\n<h3>Swift</h3>\n<p>Swift is the\
    \ component that provides object storage for OpenStack. With your\ncredentials\
    \ and via a URL you can request Swift to reserve &amp; create storage\n(called\
    \ containers or buckets). Files (known as objects when stored in Swift)\ncan then\
    \ be uploaded and accessed similarly by your running virtual machines.</p>\n<p>The\
    \ NeCTAR implementation of Swift is geodistributed across Nodes of the NeCTAR\n\
    Cloud so that availability is not rely on any one data center or network\ninfrastructure.\
    \ Each collection of Swift nodes/hardware is known as a region,\nwhich may or\
    \ may not include a Swift proxy server (the Internet facing and\nserving component\
    \ of Swift). With some Swift clients/APIs users can explicitly\nchose which proxy\
    \ to connect to, this might be useful e.g. for speeding up\nwrites to object storage\
    \ by choosing the nearest proxy. Due to NeCTAR's Swift\nhaving multiple regions\
    \ (some of which are Node private) some clients/APIs\nrequire explicit configuration\
    \ of a default region, which should be \"Melbourne\"\nfor most users.</p>", parent: 21,

    \ Expert--DOCID19/Heat--DOCID42/images/glossy_flame.png?raw=true\"> Heat</h1>\n\
    <p>Heat is a template driven service that automates the management of the entire\n\
    lifecycle of your application on the NeCTAR cloud.</p>\n<p>A 'template driven\
    \ service' simply means that you define your application's\nrequirements in a\
    \ human readable text file - the template. In this file you to\ndescribe both\
    \ the infrastructure and its relationships that your application\nwill need to\
    \ run on the NeCTAR cloud.</p>\n<p>Heat then uses this template to provision the\
    \ required infrastructure and\nmanage the lifecycle of your application from start\
    \ to finish. This template,\nand the infrastructure that it has created, is termed\
    \ a 'stack'.</p>\n<p>As part of the life cycle management, the Heat service supports\
    \ both scaling on\ndemand and the freeing up of infrastructure once the application\
    \ is finished.</p>\n<p>Heat integrates well with configuration management tools,\
    \ such as Chef and\nPuppet. Thus the Heat service offers executable documentation\
    \ of your\napplication's deployment and lifecycle, making your deployments repeatable\
    \ and\nreliable. The net effect is to limit human error and to save you time.\
    \ Thus\nsaving you money.</p>\n<h2>The stack template format(s)</h2>\n<p>Heat\
    \ is modelled after Amazon's <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html\"\
    >CloudFormation</a>\nservice, and endeavours to maintain some degree of compatibility\
    \ with this\nservice. Hence Heat supports two different template formats.</p>\n\
    <ul>\n<li>The first is a <a href=\"http://www.json.org/\">JSON</a> based implementation\
    \ that\n  mimics the Amazon specification.</li>\n<li>The second is a <a href=\"\
    http://www.yaml.org/\">YAML</a> based native OpenStack\n  implementation termed\
    \ 'HOT'.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We strongly recommend that you use the HOT format.</p>\n\
    <h2>The stack lifecycle</h2>\n<p>A template is created, using a standard text\
    \ editor (such as <a href=\"http://brackets.io/\">Brackets</a>).\nIt is then uploaded\
    \ into the OpenStack Heat service, either by means of the\nHeat command line client,\
    \ or the Horizon dashboard.</p>\n<p>If uploaded via the command line client, the\
    \ engine expects any mandatory\nparameters to be provided as arguments added at\
    \ the point the template was\nuploaded.</p>\n<p>If, however, uploaded via the\
    \ dashboard, then the dashboard will create an\ninput wizard that will step the\
    \ person who uploaded the template through the\nprocess of entering the required\
    \ parameter values.</p>\n<p>Once all the required data has been gathered the stack\
    \ is then provisioned and\nlaunched.</p>\n<p>The template and its associated parameters\
    \ will remain in the Heat database\nuntil such time as the engine is instructed\
    \ to destroy the stack.</p>\n<p>At that point all the provisioned infrastructure\
    \ will be destroyed, its\nresources released, and then the template and its parameters\
    \ will be removed\nfrom the Heat database</p>\n<h2>More information</h2>\n<p>The\

48: {html: "<h1>Just enough YAML to read a template</h1>\n<p>Heat templates are written\
    \ in a format named '<a href=\"http://yaml.org/\">YAML</a>'. This\nis a short\
    \ guide that will, hopefully, give you enough background to be able\nto work with\
    \ heat templates.</p>\n<h2>YAML</h2>\n<p>YAML is a human readable data format.</p>\n\
    <p>It's not a markup language: the format of the content gives the meaning. There\n\
    are no embedded tags! Hence indentation and justification are important.</p>\n\
    <p>Comments are preceded by a hash. A hash can appear anywhere on a line, and\
    \ will\nmark everything to the end of the line as being part of the comment.</p>\n\
    <p>```yaml</p>\n<h1>this is a comment</h1>\n<p>```</p>\n<p>Data is stored in key\
    \ value maps, wiht the key value pairs separated by a colon.</p>\n<p><code>yaml\n\
    date: 2014-01-14</code></p>\n<p>String values can be indicated by no quotes, single\
    \ quotes, or double quotes.</p>\n<p><code>yaml\nfirst-name: 'Verity'\nsurname:\
    \ \"Stobs\"\npublication: The Register</code></p>\n<p>Hashes in string values\
    \ demarcated by quotes are not seen as the start of a comment.</p>\n<p><code>yaml\n\
    example: \"# this is not a comment\" # but this is</code></p>\n<p>Double quoted\
    \ strings can contain escaped characters, such as <code>'\\n'</code> (newline).</p>\n\
    <p><code>yaml\nexample: \"This is \\n a new line\"</code></p>\n<p><code>'&gt;'</code>\
    \ Indicates that the following block of lines is a string value that will\nhave\
    \ each line break folded into a space.</p>\n<p><code>`yaml\nexample: &gt;\n  \
    \  This\n    has a value # and it is 'This has a value'</code></p>\n<p><code>'|'</code>\
    \ indicates that the following block of lines is a string value that will\nhave\
    \ the line breaks preserved.</p>\n<p>```yaml\nexample: |\n    This\n    has a\
    \ value # and it is 'This\\nhas a value'\n````</p>\n<p>The value associated with\
    \ a key can be another map of key value pairs.</p>\n<p>If this is the case then\
    \ don't provide a value: simply indent the new set of\nkey value pairs on the\
    \ following lines. So all lines prefixed by more space\nthan the parent key are\
    \ contained inside the parent key as a map of key value\npairs.</p>\n<p>All lines\
    \ in the same map have to have the same level of indentation.</p>\n<p><code>yaml\n\

49: {html: '<h1>Security Recommendations</h1>

    <p>This document lists a number of Security Recommendations to help ensure the

    safe running of your instances on the cloud. Security is important, so please

    follow these. We conduct routine and random audits to determine the integrity

    of machine images and running instances. If you have discovered a critical

    security flaw, or believe your machine has been compromised, please email

    <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#115;&#101;&#99;&#117;&#114;&#105;&#116;&#121;&#64;&#114;&#99;&#46;&#110;&#101;&#99;&#116;&#97;&#114;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#103;&#46;&#97;&#117;">&#115;&#101;&#99;&#117;&#114;&#105;&#116;&#121;&#64;&#114;&#99;&#46;&#110;&#101;&#99;&#116;&#97;&#114;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#103;&#46;&#97;&#117;</a>,

    <h2>Mail Servers</h2>

    <p>If you run a mail server, make sure it only listens on the localhost ip

    address (127.0.0.1). For many clients, if you don''t specify an SMTP server

    when sending email, it will use the recipients SMTP server automatically. This

    is probably what you want. Some nodes (Qld) disallow this and require you to

    use their SMTP server for outgoing mail.</p>

    <h2>Enable Automatic Updates</h2>

    <p>All operating systems have the ability to apply updates automatically, and
    its

    easy to turn this on. Please do so, and ask us if you need help.</p>

    <h2>Upgrade your kernel</h2>

    <p>Some updates, such as a kernel upgrade require a reboot of the instance. Please

    schedule this into your regular maintenance.</p>

    <h2>No open recursive name servers</h2>

    <p>If you are running a DNS server, please ensure you only allow recursion from

    trusted hosts.</p>

    <h2>Control or disable access to your NTP server</h2>

    <p>If you run an NTP server, limit which systems can access it. Disable the

    ''monlist'' command as this can be used as a denial of service vector on your

    system. For info about DDoS by NTP, see

    <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/understanding-and-mitigating-ntp-based-ddos-attacks/"
    title="Cloudflare Understanding NTP DDoS">this article on Cloudflare</a></p>

    <h2>Subscribe to security announcements for your OS</h2>

    <p>If there is a security problem with your Operating System, you need to find

    out as soon as possible. Find the appropriate mailing list and keep an eye

    out for anything that requires urgent action.</p>

    <h2>Run a restrictive firewall</h2>

    <p>Your instances should be configured so they allow the minimum access required

    to run their service. Please use a host-based firewall, in conjunction with

    the cloud-provided firewall to manage access.</p>

    <h2>Disable/Remove unneeded accounts</h2>

    <p>Keep an eye on the user accounts enabled on your system. Some applications

    create default accounts which are insecure.</p>

    <h2>Disable SSH password login - use keys</h2>

    <p>With enough time and compute power it is possible for passwords to be brute

    force attacked. The average SSH server deals with thousands of such attacks

    every week, so use ssh keys. Ubuntu provides some good documentation</p>

    <h2>Don''t store keys on the image</h2>

    <p>The cloud provides a metadata service so you can download keys on boot, so

    you don''t need to copy keys manually. This ensures that if your key is

    compromised, not all running instances of that image are compromised.</p>

    <h2>Install ssh attack banning tools</h2>

    <p>Install a tools like fail2ban or denyhosts, which checks log files for

    attempted breaches and then blocks malicious IP addresses.</p>

    <h2>Disable unneeded services</h2>

    <p>Know what services run on your image, and disable the unneeded ones before

    you upload it. This reduces the attack surface.</p>

    <h2>Use Encrypted Communications</h2>

    <p>Wherever possible, use encrypted communications to avoid attacks which

    intercept data.</p>

    <h2>Use best-practices for logging</h2>

    <p>Make sure that services are logging to a secure location, that is as

    tamperproof as possible. If logging remotely, ensure that it is done over

    a secure channel so that eavesdroppers cannot monitor what is happening on

    your instance.</p>', parent: 22, sha1: 7b4f6129465bb7b5fd211fc3744bebb505122d8b,

    \ a security group at boot the default security\ngroup will be applied</p>\n</blockquote>\n\
    <ul>\n<li>Each rule adds further access, it never cancels or overrides another\
    \ rule.</li>\n<li>Rules can have overlapping ranges and addresses.</li>\n<li>Rules\
    \ for the same ports and addresses can be added to more than one\n  Security Group</li>\n\
    </ul>\n<h2>Removing Network Access</h2>\n<p>To remove access to a port or from\
    \ an address locate all security groups with\nrules relating to that port or address,\
    \ then</p>\n<ul>\n<li>remove or edit each applicable rule, OR</li>\n<li>do not\
    \ apply those Security Groups that contain the applicable rule(s)</li>\n</ul>\n\
    <h2>Pre-Defined and Default Security Groups</h2>\n<p>For Project Trials (pt-xxxx)\
    \ there are pre-defined security groups for\nconvenience.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>SSH opens\
    \ tcp port 22 to traffic from all sources (for logging via ssh)</li>\n<li>HTTP\
    \ opens tcp ports 80 and 443 to traffic from all sources (for\n  web servers)</li>\n\
    <li>ICMP opens all ICMP traffic from all sources (etc. to allow pinging your\n\
    \  VMs IP address)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For all other shared projects that are created\

    \ at first. These Projects\nshare their security groups so all changes should\
    \ be made with caution as\nthey may affect instances by other users sharing your\
    \ Project.</p>\n<h2>Managing Security Groups</h2>\n<p>Sometimes it can be convenient\
    \ to organise rules into multiple Security\nGroups,\nfor example</p>\n<ul>\n<li>apply\
    \ only some or all groups depending on a instances purpose.</li>\n<li>users experimenting\
    \ with network access can remove groups and re-apply\n  them without re-creating\
    \ rules each time</li>\n<li>testing rules on a temporary security group and test\
    \ Instance before\n  adding the same rules to Security Groups already in use.\n\
    \  rules can appear in more than one Security Group</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Applying\
    \ Security Groups</h2>\n<p>Security Groups are most conveniently applied before\
    \ Launching your\ninstance, multiple security groups can be selected.\nHowever\
    \ Security Groups can also be added or removed on running instances.</p>\n<p>Click\
    \ Launch then click the Security Groups field. The default group is\npre-selected</p>\n\
    <h2>Outgoing traffic</h2>\n<p>Outgoing traffic is not blocked on any port:  connections\

    \ Nectar\nOpenStack configuration</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Security Note</p>\n<p>Using\

51: {html: "<h1>Storage</h1>\n<p>This section describes more advanced topics about\
    \ storage available for Virtual\nMachines in NecTAR Cloud.</p>\n<h2>Ephemeral\
    \ storage</h2>\n<p>Each virtual Machine you start on the NeCTAR cloud comes with\
    \ a certain amount\nof on-instance storage based on the flavour of your Virtual\
    \ Machine, which\nappear as two separate hard disks.</p>\n<p>Note: On instance\
    \ storage is reguarded as ephemeral, you should treat it as\nscratch space and\
    \ keep important data in either Volume or Object storage.</p>\n<h3>Primary Disk\
    \ (10GB)</h3>\n<p>Every Instance has a 10GB primary disk which is used for the\
    \ image you launch.\nThe Primary disk is copied in a snapshot, so anything on\
    \ this primary disk can\nbe backed up via snapshots.</p>\n<p>The name of this\
    \ device as seen from the instance is usually /dev/vda.</p>\n<p>The size of primary\
    \ disk can be vary for non-standard flavour Virtual Machines.</p>\n<h3>Secondary\
    \ Disk, 30GB to 480GB</h3>\n<p>This appears as a second hard disk in your Virtual\
    \ Machine, that you can format\nand use as you wish. For every CPU an instance\
    \ will get 30GB of additional\nsecondary storage.</p>\n<p>The size of secondary\
    \ disk can be vary for non-standard flavour Virtual\nMachines.</p>\n<p>Note: The\
    \ secondary disk is not copied or backed up via snapshots.</p>\n<p>The name of\
    \ this device as seen from the instance is usually /dev/vdb and some\nOperating\
    \ Systems will automatically format and mount the secondary disk.</p>\n<p>For\
    \ example, Ubuntu creates an ext3 partition and mounts it at /mnt</p>\n<p>you\
    \ can also format it directly, by executing:</p>\n<p><code>mkfs.ext4 /dev/vdb</code></p>\n\
    <p>Then you can mount to any directory you like, by executing:\nmount /dev/vdb\
    \ /mount point</p>\n<h3>Backup of Secondary or Ephemeral drivers</h3>\n<p>Data\
    \ on the secondary drive does not get saved in a snapshot, and requires other\n\
    storage and techniques to make a backup. For example, rsync</p>\n<h2>Volume Storage</h2>\n\
    <p>Persistent volume storage can live outside your Virtual Machine. It is appears\n\
    as block storage which can be attached then accessed and even booted from.\nThis\
    \ is a storage volume that you can attach to from within your Virtual Machine,\n\
    read and write data, detach it, and make it available to another Virtual Machine\n\
    (in same availability zone). Your data on a persistent volume is retained even\n\
    when you terminate your instance. Persistent Volumes offer a snapshot feature\n\
    which can be used to make convenient backups\n(uses some of your overall volume\
    \ quota).</p>\n<p>Volume storage are local services and only Virtual Machines\
    \ in the same\navailability zone can access it.</p>\n<p>The below guide shows\
    \ how to use a volume storage via command line are are more\nfor advanced users.\
    \ For a basic introduction and instruction for DashBoard,\nplease refer to the\
    \ storage introduction article in the Cloud Basic section.</p>\n<p>There are API\
    \ clients you can use for management of volumes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The OpenStack\
    \ <a href=\"http://docs.openstack.org/developer/python-novaclient/man/nova.html\"\

    </ul>\n<p>API normally requires 4 variables to be set for authentication:</p>\n\
    <ul>\n<li>auth URL</li>\n<li>username</li>\n<li>project id or name (most clients\
    \ can handle either)</li>\n<li>password</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When using the script\
    \ file you downloaded from NeCTAR Dashboard, these\nvarilabels are set by the\
    \ script file and you can see these variables\nif you open the file. Example:</p>\n\
    <p>OS_AUTH_URL: https://keystone.rc.nectar.org.au:5000/v2.0/\nOS_TENANT_NAME=my_science_project\n\
    OS_TENANT_ID=sdfsdfsfwrwewer\nOS_USERNAME=clouduser@example.edu.au\nOS_PASSWORD=XXXXXX</p>\n\
    <p>The below instruction assumes you use Linux operating system.</p>\n<p>Once\
    \ you have obtained the authentication script and password, you can execute\n\
    the script suing <code>source file-name.sh</code>. and type in the password you\n\
    obtained from Dashboard.</p>\n<h3>Nova API Client</h3>\n<p>To List volumes, execute\
    \ <code>nova volume-list</code></p>\n<p>To View details of a volume, execute <code>nova\
    \ volume-show volume-id</code>, you\nneed to replace the volume-id with the id\
    \ you obtained from nova volume-list</p>\n<p>To Create volume, execute</p>\n<p><code>nova\
    \ volume-create --display-name name--display-description description size</code></p>\n\
    <p>Arguments:\ndisplay-name: volume name\ndisplay-description volume description\n\
    size: volume size in GB</p>\n<p>To Delete volume, execute\n<code>nova volume-delete\
    \ &lt;volume&gt;</code></p>\n<p>Positional arguments:\n<volume>: Name or ID of\
    \ the volume to delete</p>\n<p>To Attach volume to a Virtual Machine, use command:</p>\n\
    <p><code>nova volume-attach &lt;server&gt; &lt;volume&gt; [&lt;device&gt;]</code></p>\n\
    <p>Positional arguments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>server:  Name or ID of server</p>\n\
    </li>\n<li>\n<p>volume:  ID of the volume to attach</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>device:\
    \  Name of the device e.g. /dev/vdb. Use auto for auto assign</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\
    <p>OpenStack currently ignores the specified device when attaching volumes, you\
    \ can\nspecify 'auto' to let OpenStack to decide.\nOpenStack adds the volume as\
    \ the lowest available device name:</p>\n<p>For a standard flavor Virtual Machine\
    \ (with a primary &amp; secondary drive) the\nfirst volume will be attached as\
    \ /dev/vdc.</p>\n<p>You can always execute <code>nova</code> to see what volume\
    \ command available and\nexecute <code>nova help volume command</code> for help\
    \ of the specific volume\ncommand.</p>\n<h3>Cinder API Client</h3>\n<p>Cinder\
    \ is an OpenStack project to provide \"block storage as a service\"</p>\n<p>To\
    \ List volumes, execute <code>cinder list</code></p>\n<p>To Show details of a\
    \ volume, execute <code>cinder show &lt;volume&gt;</code></p>\n<p>Positional arguments:</p>\n\
    <ul>\n<li>volume:  Name or ID of the volume.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To Create volume,\
    \ execute\n<code>cinder create --display-name name --display-description description\
    \ size</code></p>\n<p>Positional arguments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>display-name:\
    \ volume name</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>display-description volume description</p>\n\
    </li>\n<li>\n<p>size: volume size in GB</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can also create\
    \ a volume based on an existing volume or image by adding the\nthe following 2\
    \ arguments to cinder create command:</p>\n<p>--source-volid <source-volid>: Create\
    \ volume from volume id (Optional, Default=None)</p>\n<p>--image-id <image-id>\
    \ Create volume from image id (Optional, Default=None)</p>\n<p>To Delete volume,\
    \ execute</p>\n<p><code>cinder delete &lt;volume&gt;</code></p>\n<p>Positional\
    \ arguments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>volume: Name or ID of the volume to delete</li>\n\
    </ul>\n<p>To Rename volume, execute\n<code>cinder rename &lt;volume&gt; [&lt;display-name&gt;]</code></p>\n\
    <p>Positional arguments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>volume: Name or ID of the volume\
    \ to rename.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>display-name: New display-name for the volume.</p>\n\
    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cinder also provides other volume related commands such as backup,\
    \ snapshot and\nvolume type.</p>\n<p>You can always execute <code>cinder</code>\
    \ to see what volume command available and\nexecute <code>cinder help command</code>\
    \ for help of the specific volume command.</p>\n<p>Notes:\nThere are more API\
    \ clients avaible to manage the Volument Storage, please refer\nto the releanve\
    \ documents or search through Internet.</p>\n<h3>Client Python API</h3>\n<p>Rather\
    \ than running the client API in command line, Client API can also be used\nwithin\
    \ the Python code.</p>\n<p>The nova and cinder Python API client can be installed\
    \ easily by using pip\ncommand. Please refer to the relevant <a href=\"https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html\"\

    \ Python API:</p>\n<p><code>from cinderclient import client\ncinder = client.Client(VERSION,\
    \ USERNAME, PASSWORD, PROJECT_NAME, AUTH_URL)\ncinder.volumes.list()\ncinder.attach(parameters)\n\

    \ and commands please refer to\n<a href=\"http://docs.openstack.org/developer/python-cinderclient/\"\
    >Cinder Python API</a></p>\n<h3>Boot from Volume</h3>\n<p>You can use the below\
    \ command to boot from volume:</p>\n<p><code>nova boot --flavor m1.small --key_name\
    \ &lt;mykey&gt; --block_device_mapping vda=&lt;volume-id&gt;:::0 &lt;instance_name&gt;</code></p>\n\
    <p>Note:\nChanging the '0' to '1' changes the delete_on_terminate option to delete\
    \ the\nvolume on instance termination</p>\n<h3>Use Volume within Virtual Machine</h3>\n\
    <p>A new Volume may not have a filesystem (depending on how it was created) and\
    \ you\nneed to create one before mounting.</p>\n<p>The exact mount command syntax\
    \ is dependent on the Virtual Machines' operating\nsystem and the type of filesystem\
    \ you require.</p>\n<p>You can use the below command to create ext4 file system\
    \ and assumes volume is\non vdc:</p>\n<p><code>sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/vdc</code></p>\n\
    <p>Warning: creating new file system can cause data loss if a filesystem already\n\
    exists on the target volume.</p>\n<p>The exact mount command syntax is dependent\
    \ on the Virtual Machine' Operating\nSystem, so the advice can only be generic.\
    \ eg</p>\n<p><code>sudo mount /dev/vdc /mnt -t auto</code></p>\n<p>This will mount\
    \ the disk if the type of file-system can be guessed, otherwise\nyou may have\
    \ to specify \"-t file-system-type\".</p>\n<p>If you did not create and format\
    \ the Volume then you might work out the\nfile-system type by executing the below\
    \ command:</p>\n<p><code>sudo parted -l</code></p>\n<p>Finally if you want the\
    \ filesystem auto-mounted at boot consider changing the\n\"/etc/fstab\" (or equivalent\
    \ for your OS) which specifies devices and mountpoints\nand whether to mount them\
    \ automatically or just be aware they exist and allow\nsimplified mounting sytax\
    \ such as:</p>\n<p><code>mount  /mnt\nor\nmount /device</code></p>\n<h2>Object\
    \ Storage</h2>\n<p>Object Storage is not a traditional file-system or real-time\
    \ data storage system.\nIt's designed for mostly static data that can be retrieved,\
    \ leveraged, and then\nupdated if necessary. It is independant of a particular\
    \ Virtual Machine and can\nbe updated and used without having any Virtual Machine\
    \ running. It is designed\nto be redundant and scalable.</p>\n<h3>Concept</h3>\n\
    <p>Think about that dataset comprised of 2GB files that you read in and analyse\n\
    many times, but in general it doesn't change. Or the images you want to use on\n\
    the cloud. Those are a couple examples of what's perfect for Object Storage.\n\
    Objects are written to multiple hardware devices in the data cente to ensure\n\
    integrity, and great performance!</p>\n<p>In general, the object store is great\
    \ for data you write once and read many\ntimes, but not suitable for applications\
    \ like databases. It's the safest place\nto put your data on the NeCTAR Research\
    \ Cloud as multiple redundant copies of\nyour data are made, and it has great\
    \ performance. You can access the object\nstore from anywhere on the Internet,\
    \ and data from Object Storage can be\ntransferred to and from your Virtual Machine\
    \ with a variety of http-capable\ntools.</p>\n<h3>Swift</h3>\n<p>Swift is the\
    \ component that provides object storage for OpenStack. With your\ncredentials\
    \ and via a URL you can request Swift to reserve &amp; create storage\n(called\
    \ containers or buckets). Files (known as objects when stored in Swift)\ncan then\
    \ be uploaded and accessed similarly by your running Virtual Machines.</p>\n<p>The\
    \ NeCTAR implementation of Swift is geodistributed across Nodes of the\nResearch\
    \ Cloud so that availability is not reliant on any one datacentre or\nnetwork\
    \ infrastructure. Each collection of Swift nodes/hardware is known as a\nregion,\
    \ which may or may not include a Swift proxy server (the Internet facing\nand\
    \ serving component of Swift). With some Swift clients/APIs users can\nexplicitly\
    \ chose which proxy to connect to, this might be useful e.g. for\nspeeding up\
    \ writes to object storage by choosing the nearest proxy. Due to\nNeCTAR's Swift\
    \ having multiple regions (some of which are Node private) some\nclients/APIs\
    \ require explicit configuration of a default region, which should\nbe \"Melbourne\"\
    \ for most users.</p>\n<p>Swift does not provide encryption of the data it stores.\
    \ If you have sensitive\ndata that requires encryption you must encrypt the data\
    \ files before upload.</p>\n<h3>Swift Command Line Client</h3>\n<p>The swift client\
    \ is the command-line interface (CLI) for the OpenStack Object\nAPI and its extensions.</p>\n\
    <p>It is same as nova client and cinder lcient, you need to authente before you\
    \ can\nuse the it. Please refer the above instruction about how to get authenticated.</p>\n\
    <p>Please also refer above instruction for how to install the swift client.</p>\n\
    <p>To list all containers, execute:</p>\n<p><code>swift list</code></p>\n<p>To\
    \ list all objects under a container, execute:</p>\n<p><code>swift list [container]</code></p>\n\
    <p>Positional arguments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>container: Name of container to list object\
    \ in</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To create a container, execute</p>\n<p><code>swift post [container]</code></p>\n\
    <p>Positional arguments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>container: Name of container to create</li>\n\
    </ul>\n<p>To delete a container and a object within it, execute:</p>\n<p><code>swift\
    \ delete [container][object]</code></p>\n<p>Positional arguments:\ncontainer:\
    \ Name of container to delete from\nobject: Name of object ot delete. Specify\
    \ multiple times for multiple objects</p>\n<p>To upload files or directories to\
    \ the given container, execute:</p>\n<p><code>swift upload &lt;container&gt; &lt;file_or_directory&gt;</code></p>\n\
    <p>Positional arguments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>container: Name of container to upload\
    \ to</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>file_or_directory: Name of file or directory to uploaded.\
    \ Specify multiple\n times for multiple uploads</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To download\
    \ objects from a given container, execute:</p>\n<p><code>swift download &lt;container&gt;\
    \ [object]</code></p>\n<p>Positional arguments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>container:\
    \ Name of container to download from. To download a whole account,\n omit this\
    \ and specify --all</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>object: Name of object to download. Specify\
    \ multiple times for multiple\n objects. Omit this to download all objects from\
    \ the container</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can execute <code>swift</code> to see\
    \ what commands are avaiable and\nrun <code>swift command -h</code> find out more\
    \ information about a command.</p>\n<h3>Client python API</h3>\n<p>You can also\
    \ use swift python API to access and manage the object storage.\nThe below shows\
    \ the sample Pthon code:</p>\n<p>```\nfrom swiftclient import client</p>\n<p>swift\
    \ = client.Connection(authurl=url, user=username, key=password,\ntenant_name=project_name,\
    \ auth_version='2')</p>\n<p>container_name=\"\"\nswift.get_container(container_name)</p>\n\
    <p>container_name=\"first container\"\nswift.put_container(container_name)</p>\n\
    <p>swift.delete_container(container_name)</p>\n<p>container_name = \"container\"\
    \nobject_name = \"object\"\nswift.get_object(container_name, object_name)</p>\n\
    <p>swift.put_object(container_name, object)\n```</p>\n<p>Please refer to above\
    \ instruction about how to obtain authurl, user, password and\ntenant_name.</p>\n\
    <p>To get a container, use swift.get_container(container_name) method, if you\n\
    provide a empty string to the container_name parameter, it returns all\ncontainers\
    \ in your project.</p>\n<p>To create a container, use swift.post_container(container_name)\
    \ method.</p>\n<p>To delete a container, use swift.delete_container(container_name)\
    \ method.</p>\n<p>To get a object, use swift.get_object(container_name, object_name)\
    \ method.</p>\n<p>To upload a object, use swift.put_object(container_name, object)\
    \ method.</p>\n<p>Please refer to the <a href=\"http://docs.openstack.org/developer/python-swiftclient/index.html\"\
    >swift python cliet document</a> for more\ninformation.</p>\n<h2>Storage Performance</h2>\n\
    <p>Storage performance is various based on that the implementation of each node\
    \ may\ntake different storage approach and due to differences in hardware. For\
    \ example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>faster spindle speeds</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>SSD\
    \ cache</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>local storage on compute nodes</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\
    <p>shared storage across compute nodes</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>underline network\
    \ infrastructure</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The storage performance also depends largely\
    \ on the choice of file system and\nthe way how applications operates.</p>\n<p>The\
    \ below tables shows a comparison of various data storage features:</p>\n<table>\n\
    <thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Storage type</th>\n<th>Saved in snapshot</th>\n<th>Data integrity</th>\n\
    <th>Access</th>\n<th>Back up</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>On-instance\
    \ Primary Disk</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>Ok</td>\n<td>Block</td>\n<td>No</td>\n\
    </tr>\n<tr>\n<td>On-instance Secondary Disk</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>Ok</td>\n<td>Block</td>\n\
    <td>No</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Volumes</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>Good</td>\n<td>Block</td>\n\
    <td>No</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Object Storage</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>Best</td>\n\
    <td>HTTP</td>\n<td>No</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Notes:\nData Integrity\
    \ means how your data exposed to hardware errors.\nAccess means how storage gets\
    \ access through eith Block level device (like\nattaching a hard drive to a computer)\
    \ or HTTP where you use access data\nvia HTTP protocol.\nBack up means whehter\
    \ there is a recoverable copy of a file available after a\nfile is updated, deleted\
    \ or damaged.</p>\n<h3>Performance Tuning</h3>\n<p>If you experience slow storage\
    \ access, some storage performance tuning can be\ndone inside the Virtual Machine.</p>\n\
    <ul>\n<li>Use the noop I/O scheduler if possibile. Other Virtual machine scheduler\n\
    \ conflicts with hypervisor scheduler. If the device boots with grub, this can\
    \ be\n added as the kernel command line option</li>\n</ul>\n<p><code>elevator=noop</code></p>\n\
    <ul>\n<li>Virtual Machine disk partitions should be correctly alligned to the\
    \ underlying\n filesystem, otherwise I/O performance will be degraded. A quick\
    \ way to check if\n your Virtual Machine's partition alligned is to check with\
    \ <code>fdisk -lu</code>.\n Each partition should start on sector divisible by\
    \ 8.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After the performance tuning and you still have slow storage\
    \ access, you can\ncontact the NeCTAR help desk.</p>", parent: 22, sha1: 4ece6f2fb922e7e616059d26d592035337a1c221,
