        desc_un_html: " Heat is a template driven service that automates the management\
          \ of the entire\nlifecycle of your application on the NeCTAR cloud. \n A\
          \ 'template driven service' simply means that you define your application's\n\
          requirements in a human readable text file - the template. In this file\
          \ you to\ndescribe both the infrastructure and its relationships that your\
          \ application\nwill need to run on the NeCTAR cloud. \n Heat then uses this\
          \ template to provision the required infrastructure and\nmanage the lifecycle\
          \ of your application from start to finish. This template,\nand the infrastructure\
          \ that it has created, is termed a 'stack'. \n As part of the life cycle\
          \ management, the Heat service supports both scaling\non demand and the\
          \ freeing up of infrastructure once the application is\nfinished. \n Heat\
          \ integrates well with configuration management tools, such as Chef and\n\
          Puppet. Thus the Heat service offers executable documentation of your\n\
          application's deployment and lifecycle, making your deployments repeatable\
          \ and\nreliable. The net effect is to limit human error and to save you\
          \ time. Thus\nsaving you money. \n The stack template format(s) \n Heat\
          \ is modelled after Amazon's CloudFormation service, and\nendeavours to\
          \ maintain some degree of comparability with this service. Hence\nHeat supports\
          \ two different template formats. \n \n The first is a JSON based implementation\
          \ that mimics the Amazon specification. \n The second is a YAML based native\
          \ OpenStack implementation. \n \n The stack lifecycle \n A template is created,\
          \ using a standard text editor (such as Notepad++). It is then uploaded\
          \ into the OpenStack Heat\nservice, either by means of the Heat command\
          \ line client, or the Horizon\ndashboard. \n If uploaded via the command\
          \ line client, the engine expects any mandatory\nparameters to be provided\
          \ as arguments added at the point the template was\nuploaded. \n If, however,\
          \ uploaded via the dashboard, then the dashboard will create an\ninput wizard\
          \ that will step the person who uploaded the template through the\nprocess\
          \ of entering the required parameter values. \n Once all the required data\
          \ has been gathered the stack is then provisioned and\nlaunched. \n The\
          \ template and its associated parameters will remain in the Heat database\n\
          until such time as the engine is instructed to destroy the stack. \n At\
          \ that point all the provisioned infrastructure will be destroyed, its\n\
          resources released, and then the template and its parameters will be removed\n\
          from the Heat database. \n We have created a screencast that that does a\
          \ walk through of this lifecycle:\nHeat: a screencast. \n More information\
          \ \n The following pages offer more in depth technical information on using\
          \ Heat in\nthe NeCTAR cloud. \n \n \nHeat: enough YAML to read a template\
          \ (usefull if you don't know YAML) \n \nHeat: walk through of a YAML template\
          \ - a walk through of a Heat template that is in use on the NeCTAR cloud.\

          \ \n \n AWS::CloudFormation::WaitConditionHandle \n OS::Heat::HARestarter\
          \ \n AWS::AutoScaling::ScalingPolicy \n AWS::IAM::User \n \n This is a known\
          \ issue and should be resolved in the next release of OpenStack. \n No root\
          \ certificates message \n If you get an error stating that \"No root certificates\
          \ specified for\nverification of other-side certificates\" when using the\
          \ command line then the\nwork around is to use the --insecure flag: \n heat\
          \ --insecure stack-list \n This stops the server's certificate from being\
          \ verified against any certficate\nauthority. Not the greatest solution,\
          \ but a solution for the time being. "

          describe both the infrastructure and its relationships that your application

          will need to run on the NeCTAR cloud.</p>

          <p>Heat then uses this template to provision the required infrastructure
          and

          manage the lifecycle of your application from start to finish. This template,

          and the infrastructure that it has created, is termed a ''stack''.</p>

          <p>As part of the life cycle management, the Heat service supports both
          scaling

          on demand and the freeing up of infrastructure once the application is

          finished.</p>

          <p>Heat integrates well with configuration management tools, such as Chef
          and

          Puppet. Thus the Heat service offers executable documentation of your

          application''s deployment and lifecycle, making your deployments repeatable
          and

          reliable. The net effect is to limit human error and to save you time. Thus

          saving you money.</p>

          <h2>The stack template format(s)</h2>

          <p>Heat is modelled after Amazon''s <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AW%0ASCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html?r=7078">CloudFormation</a>
          service, and

          endeavours to maintain some degree of comparability with this service. Hence

          Heat supports two different template formats.</p>

          <ul>

          <li>The first is a <a href="http://www.json.org/">JSON</a> based implementation
          that mimics the Amazon specification.</li>

          <li>The second is a <a href="http://www.yaml.org/">YAML</a> based native
          OpenStack implementation.</li>

          </ul>

          <h2>The stack lifecycle</h2>

          <p>A template is created, using a standard text editor (such as <a>Notepad++</a>).
          It is then uploaded into the OpenStack Heat

          service, either by means of the Heat command line client, or the Horizon

          dashboard.</p>

          <p>If uploaded via the command line client, the engine expects any mandatory

          parameters to be provided as arguments added at the point the template was

          uploaded.</p>

          <p>If, however, uploaded via the dashboard, then the dashboard will create
          an

          input wizard that will step the person who uploaded the template through
          the

          process of entering the required parameter values.</p>

          <p>Once all the required data has been gathered the stack is then provisioned
          and

          launched.</p>

          <p>The template and its associated parameters will remain in the Heat database

          until such time as the engine is instructed to destroy the stack.</p>

          <p>At that point all the provisioned infrastructure will be destroyed, its

          resources released, and then the template and its parameters will be removed

          from the Heat database.</p>

          <p>We have created a screencast that that does a walk through of this lifecycle:

          \ Introduction to user documentation about Nectar Cloud. \n \n NeCTAR welcome\
          \ and introduction \n Welcome to the Nectar Cloud knowledge base. Browse\
          \ or search our\nuser documentation, and if you can\u2019t find what you\u2019\
          re looking\nfor contact our support team at [email] or [phone]. \n What\
          \ is the Nectar Cloud \n Nectar (National eResearch\nCollaboration Tools\
          \ and Resources) is\nan Australian Government project funded to build new\n\
          infrastructure specifically for the\nneeds of Australian researchers. All\
          \ Australian researchers\nhave access to the Nectar Cloud via the\nAAF.\
          \ \n To access the cloud all users must first login through the\nNectar\
          \ Cloud dashboard:\nhttps://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au/ \n Instances \n\
          \ Instances running inside the Research Cloud are just like\nreal-life machines\
          \ but in a\nremote location. The Research Cloud is used to start, copy\n\
          and delete instances.\nThey have an operating system (you select it from\
          \ a list),\nnetwork access (a real IP\naddress & you specify any access),\
          \ and hard disk storage. With\nno hardware to\nmaintain you can copy (Snapshot)\
          \ and customise new machines\nrapidly. \n Tools \n The Nectar Cloud Dashboard\
          \ \n The Dashboard provides a web interface to get all the basic\nResearch\
          \ Cloud related jobs done. \n Use the dashboard: \n \n for basic Cloud operations:\
          \ (launching, duplicating & terminating ) instances \n to get [Credentials]\
          \ you can use with other [API clients] \n to make an allocation request\
          \ for a larger ongoing share of Research Cloud Resources. \n \n More about\
          \ instances \n If you are familiar with connecting to remote machines already\n\
          the same tools and techniques apply when connecting to running\ninstances.\
          \ Your instance has a public IP address and, if\nconfigured, can be reached\
          \ and controlled with any remote\naccess tools you wish to use. Example\
          \ SSH. \n More information about launching and managing instances is here\
          \ \n Images \n Instances originate from Images and can be a plain \"off\
          \ the\nshelf\" Operating System or include software packages and\nconfig\
          \ changes to suit a particular purpose (eg Webserving).\nThere are publicly\
          \ available images in the cloud ready for\nyou to use. \n To suit your specific\
          \ purposes an instance may need some\ncustomisation, configuration changes\
          \ or software installation.\nIts a good idea to make a copy of the instance\
          \ if you wish to\nre-use its current state as a starting point for new instances.\n\
          If you are experimenting and making changes, a copy allows you\nto return\
          \ to the copied state and dispose of the experiment\nwithout having to undo/redo\
          \ configuration changes. \n You can create an Image from scratch, but usually\
          \ its easier\nto customise & copy a running instance that is close\nto what\
          \ you need. \n Copies of instances are called Snapshots and can be used\n\
          like other Images to start new instances. Making a Snapshot\nis simple:\
          \ \n \n Go to the Dashboard \u2018Instances\u2019 tab \n Click \"Create\
          \ Snapshot\" for the running instance you wish to copy. \n \n Keypairs \n\
          \ Key Pairs enable you to communicate with your instance via\nSSH. When\
          \ launching an instance you specify an existing key\npair. The public key\
          \ is injected into the running\ninstance's authorized_keys file. \n You\
          \ can manage your keypairs through the Dashboard or via\nthe nova CLI client.\
          \ \n In the dashboard under the Access & Security tab you can\nmanage your\
          \ keys. You have the option of: \n \n Importing an existing SSH key you\
          \ own \n Creating a new SSH Key \n \n Important: Keypairs can only be specified\
          \ on instance\ncreation, if you don't specify a keypair on creation you\
          \ will\nnot be able to add it later. \n Security groups \n Incoming network\
          \ access to your machines is usually required.\nSecurity Groups are how\
          \ to add network access. If you can't\nreach your instance by SSH to login\
          \ or by browser if it\nruns a Webserver additional Security Group settings\
          \ could be\nneeded. \n [Add link to more info] \n Storage in the cloud \n\
          \ The NeCTAR Research Cloud provides instances for research\nuse. While\
          \ resources like processing cores, RAM and the\namount of storage you get\
          \ are dedicated to a particular\ninstance, other resources like the network\
          \ and the underlying\nstorage system are shared among instances. Furthermore,\
          \ not\nall storage is created equal, and Research Cloud users\nhave a few\
          \ different types of storage available which differ\naccording to performance,\
          \ persistence and data safety. \n To find out which storage option is right\
          \ for you. We need\nto write the documentation for it. [LINK] "

    \ Introduction to user documentation about Nectar Cloud.</p>\n<hr>\n<h1>NeCTAR\
    \ welcome and introduction</h1>\n<p>Welcome to the Nectar Cloud knowledge base.\
    \ Browse or search our\nuser documentation, and if you can\u2019t find what you\u2019\
    re looking\nfor contact our support team at [email] or [phone].</p>\n<h2>What\
    \ is the Nectar Cloud</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://nectar.org.au/\">Nectar</a> (National\
    \ eResearch\nCollaboration Tools and Resources) is\nan Australian Government project\
    \ funded to build new\ninfrastructure specifically for the\nneeds of Australian\
    \ researchers. All Australian researchers\nhave access to the Nectar Cloud via\
    \ the\n<a href=\"http://support.rc.nectar.org.au/node/111\">AAF</a>.</p>\n<p>To\
    \ access the cloud all users must first login through the\nNectar Cloud dashboard:\n\
    <a href=\"https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au/\">https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au/</a></p>\n\
    <h2>Instances</h2>\n<p>Instances running inside the Research Cloud are just like\n\
    real-life machines but in a\nremote location. The Research Cloud is used to start,\
    \ copy\nand delete instances.\nThey have an operating system (you select it from\
    \ a list),\nnetwork access (a real IP\naddress &amp; you specify any access),\
    \ and hard disk storage. With\nno hardware to\nmaintain you can copy (Snapshot)\
    \ and customise new machines\nrapidly.</p>\n<h2>Tools</h2>\n<h3>The Nectar Cloud\
    \ Dashboard</h3>\n<p>The Dashboard provides a web interface to get all the basic\n\
    Research Cloud related jobs done.</p>\n<p>Use the dashboard:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>for\
    \ basic Cloud operations: (launching, duplicating &amp; terminating ) instances</li>\n\
    <li>to get [Credentials] you can use with other [API clients]</li>\n<li>to make\
    \ an allocation request for a larger ongoing share of Research Cloud Resources.</li>\n\
    </ul>\n<h3>More about instances</h3>\n<p>If you are familiar with connecting to\
    \ remote machines already\nthe same tools and techniques apply when connecting\
    \ to running\ninstances. Your instance has a public IP address and, if\nconfigured,\
    \ can be reached and controlled with any remote\naccess tools you wish to use.\
    \ Example SSH.</p>\n<p>More information about launching and managing instances\
    \ is here</p>\n<h3>Images</h3>\n<p>Instances originate from Images and can be\
    \ a plain \"off the\nshelf\" Operating System or include software packages and\n\
    config changes to suit a particular purpose (eg Webserving).\nThere are publicly\
    \ available images in the cloud ready for\nyou to use.</p>\n<p>To suit your specific\
    \ purposes an instance may need some\ncustomisation, configuration changes or\
    \ software installation.\nIts a good idea to make a copy of the instance if you\
    \ wish to\nre-use its current state as a starting point for new instances.\nIf\
    \ you are experimenting and making changes, a copy allows you\nto return to the\
    \ copied state and dispose of the experiment\nwithout having to undo/redo configuration\
    \ changes.</p>\n<p>You can create an Image from scratch, but usually its easier\n\
    to customise &amp; copy a running instance that is close\nto what you need.</p>\n\
    <p>Copies of instances are called Snapshots and can be used\nlike other Images\
    \ to start new instances. Making a Snapshot\nis simple:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to the\
    \ Dashboard \u2018Instances\u2019 tab</li>\n<li>Click \"Create Snapshot\" for\
    \ the running instance you wish to copy.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Keypairs</h2>\n<p>Key\
    \ Pairs enable you to communicate with your instance via\nSSH. When launching\
    \ an instance you specify an existing key\npair. The public key is injected into\
    \ the running\ninstance's authorized_keys file.</p>\n<p>You can manage your keypairs\
    \ through the Dashboard or via\nthe nova CLI client.</p>\n<p>In the dashboard\
    \ under the Access &amp; Security tab you can\nmanage your keys. You have the\
    \ option of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Importing an existing SSH key you own</li>\n<li>Creating\
    \ a new SSH Key</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Important:</strong> Keypairs can only\
    \ be specified on instance\ncreation, if you don't specify a keypair on creation\
    \ you will\nnot be able to add it later.</p>\n<h2>Security groups</h2>\n<p>Incoming\
    \ network access to your machines is usually required.\nSecurity Groups are how\
    \ to add network access. If you can't\nreach your instance by SSH to login or\
    \ by browser if it\nruns a Webserver additional Security Group settings could\
    \ be\nneeded.</p>\n<p>[Add link to more info]</p>\n<h2>Storage in the cloud</h2>\n\
    <p>The NeCTAR Research Cloud provides instances for research\nuse. While resources\
    \ like processing cores, RAM and the\namount of storage you get are dedicated\
    \ to a particular\ninstance, other resources like the network and the underlying\n\
    storage system are shared among instances. Furthermore, not\nall storage is created\
    \ equal, and Research Cloud users\nhave a few different types of storage available\
    \ which differ\naccording to performance, persistence and data safety.</p>\n<p>To\
    \ find out which storage option is right for you. We need\nto write the documentation\
    \ for it. [LINK]</p>"
