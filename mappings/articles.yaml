        desc_un_html: " Heat is a template driven service that automates the management\
          \ of the entire\nlifecycle of your application on the NeCTAR cloud. \n A\
          \ 'template driven service' simply means that you define your application's\n\
          requirements in a human readable text file - the template. In this file\
          \ you to\ndescribe both the infrastructure and its relationships that your\
          \ application\nwill need to run on the NeCTAR cloud. \n Heat then uses this\
          \ template to provision the required infrastructure and\nmanage the lifecycle\
          \ of your application from start to finish. This template,\nand the infrastructure\
          \ that it has created, is termed a 'stack'. \n As part of the life cycle\
          \ management, the Heat service supports both scaling\non demand and the\
          \ freeing up of infrastructure once the application is\nfinished. \n Heat\
          \ integrates well with configuration management tools, such as Chef and\n\
          Puppet. Thus the Heat service offers executable documentation of your\n\
          application's deployment and lifecycle, making your deployments repeatable\
          \ and\nreliable. The net effect is to limit human error and to save you\
          \ time. Thus\nsaving you money. \n The stack template format(s) \n Heat\
          \ is modelled after Amazon's CloudFormation service, and\nendeavours to\
          \ maintain some degree of comparability with this service. Hence\nHeat supports\
          \ two different template formats. \n \n The first is a JSON based implementation\
          \ that mimics the Amazon specification. \n The second is a YAML based native\
          \ OpenStack implementation. \n \n The stack lifecycle \n A template is created,\
          \ using a standard text editor (such as Notepad++). It is then uploaded\
          \ into the OpenStack Heat\nservice, either by means of the Heat command\
          \ line client, or the Horizon\ndashboard. \n If uploaded via the command\
          \ line client, the engine expects any mandatory\nparameters to be provided\
          \ as arguments added at the point the template was\nuploaded. \n If, however,\
          \ uploaded via the dashboard, then the dashboard will create an\ninput wizard\
          \ that will step the person who uploaded the template through the\nprocess\
          \ of entering the required parameter values. \n Once all the required data\
          \ has been gathered the stack is then provisioned and\nlaunched. \n The\
          \ template and its associated parameters will remain in the Heat database\n\
          until such time as the engine is instructed to destroy the stack. \n At\
          \ that point all the provisioned infrastructure will be destroyed, its\n\
          resources released, and then the template and its parameters will be removed\n\
          from the Heat database. \n We have created a screencast that that does a\
          \ walk through of this lifecycle:\nHeat: a screencast. \n More information\
          \ \n The following pages offer more in depth technical information on using\
          \ Heat in\nthe NeCTAR cloud. \n \n \nHeat: enough YAML to read a template\
          \ (usefull if you don't know YAML) \n \nHeat: walk through of a YAML template\
          \ - a walk through of a Heat template that is in use on the NeCTAR cloud.\

          \ \n \n AWS::CloudFormation::WaitConditionHandle \n OS::Heat::HARestarter\
          \ \n AWS::AutoScaling::ScalingPolicy \n AWS::IAM::User \n \n This is a known\
          \ issue and should be resolved in the next release of OpenStack. \n No root\
          \ certificates message \n If you get an error stating that \"No root certificates\
          \ specified for\nverification of other-side certificates\" when using the\
          \ command line then the\nwork around is to use the --insecure flag: \n heat\
          \ --insecure stack-list \n This stops the server's certificate from being\
          \ verified against any certficate\nauthority. Not the greatest solution,\
          \ but a solution for the time being. "

          describe both the infrastructure and its relationships that your application

          will need to run on the NeCTAR cloud.</p>

          <p>Heat then uses this template to provision the required infrastructure
          and

          manage the lifecycle of your application from start to finish. This template,

          and the infrastructure that it has created, is termed a ''stack''.</p>

          <p>As part of the life cycle management, the Heat service supports both
          scaling

          on demand and the freeing up of infrastructure once the application is

          finished.</p>

          <p>Heat integrates well with configuration management tools, such as Chef
          and

          Puppet. Thus the Heat service offers executable documentation of your

          application''s deployment and lifecycle, making your deployments repeatable
          and

          reliable. The net effect is to limit human error and to save you time. Thus

          saving you money.</p>

          <h2>The stack template format(s)</h2>

          <p>Heat is modelled after Amazon''s <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AW%0ASCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html?r=7078">CloudFormation</a>
          service, and

          endeavours to maintain some degree of comparability with this service. Hence

          Heat supports two different template formats.</p>

          <ul>

          <li>The first is a <a href="http://www.json.org/">JSON</a> based implementation
          that mimics the Amazon specification.</li>

          <li>The second is a <a href="http://www.yaml.org/">YAML</a> based native
          OpenStack implementation.</li>

          </ul>

          <h2>The stack lifecycle</h2>

          <p>A template is created, using a standard text editor (such as <a>Notepad++</a>).
          It is then uploaded into the OpenStack Heat

          service, either by means of the Heat command line client, or the Horizon

          dashboard.</p>

          <p>If uploaded via the command line client, the engine expects any mandatory

          parameters to be provided as arguments added at the point the template was

          uploaded.</p>

          <p>If, however, uploaded via the dashboard, then the dashboard will create
          an

          input wizard that will step the person who uploaded the template through
          the

          process of entering the required parameter values.</p>

          <p>Once all the required data has been gathered the stack is then provisioned
          and

          launched.</p>

          <p>The template and its associated parameters will remain in the Heat database

          until such time as the engine is instructed to destroy the stack.</p>

          <p>At that point all the provisioned infrastructure will be destroyed, its

          resources released, and then the template and its parameters will be removed

          from the Heat database.</p>

          <p>We have created a screencast that that does a walk through of this lifecycle:

        desc_un_html: " Launching Virtual Machine \n This guide helps to launch a\
          \ running instance (virtual machine) with SSH login\nenabled. \n Preparation\
          \ \n You need to create a public/private key pairs before you can use SSH\
          \ to login to\nthe newly created instance. The public will be inserted into\
          \ the instance and\nthe private key is used on your desktop/laptop. \n Windows\
          \ User \n Use PuTTYgen key generator to generate the required key pair.\
          \ \n \n \n Download PuTTYgen (puttygen.exe) from PuTTYgen download page\
          \ \n \n \n Launch the PuTTYgen application by double clicking the puttygen.exe\
          \ \n \n \n Default setting is fine for this case, click the 'Generate' button\
          \ \n \n \n Save your public key by clicking 'Save public key' button. You\
          \ should give a\n name that you can better identify the key in the future\
          \ \n \n \n Save your private key by clicking 'Save private key' button.\
          \ It is the same\n as public key to give a sensible name for future reference.\
          \ Ignore the\n passphrase \n \n \n Linux/Mac User \n Type ssh-keygen in\
          \ console and enter. This generates a public key (id_rsa.pub)\nand a private\
          \ key(id_rsa). By default, the two keys are located in ~/.ssh \n Import\
          \ Public Key \n Public key generated by Windows/Linux/Mac are required to\
          \ be imported into\nNeCTAR cloud dash board before use. \n \n \n Log into\
          \ the dashboard at Cloud Dashboard \n \n \n Go to Access and Security Tab\
          \ and then to the Keypairs page \n \n \n Click 'Import Key Pair' button\
          \ \n \n \n Type in a keypair name and paste the contents of the public key.\
          \ For Windows\n User, open PuTTYgen and click 'Load' button to load the\
          \ related private key and\n copy/paste the public key contents. For Linux/Mac\
          \ user, type cat id_rsa.pub and\n copy/paste the public key contest from\
          \ console output \n \n \n NeCTAR Cloud Dashboard \n Key pairs can also be\
          \ created directly through the NeCTAR Cloud Dashboard. \n \n \n login to\
          \ the dashboard at Cloud Dashboard \n \n \n Go to Access and Security Tab\
          \ and then to the Keypairs page \n \n \n Click 'Create Key Pair' button\
          \ \n \n \n Type in a keypair name in the pop out window and click 'Create\
          \ Key Pair'\n button \n \n \n Save the private key into a directory \n \n\
          \ \n Notes:\nIf you are running a Windows machine the SSH private key may\
          \ need to be\nconverted (use PuTTYgen for converting keys) \n \n \n Open\
          \ PuTTYgen \n \n \n Click 'Load' button to load private key \n \n \n Click\
          \ 'Export OpenSSH key' from 'Conversions' menu \n \n \n Type a private key\
          \ name and save \n \n \n Select an Image \n You need to select an image\
          \ to be used for your instance. The image defines what\noperating system\
          \ the instance uses and thus you need to select an image based on\nyour\
          \ needs. NecTAR Cloud offers a list of predefined official images and for\n\
          simplicity, these images are recommended. You can find a complete list of\n\
          official images from NeCTAR image catalog. You can also find all\navailable\
          \ from Cloud Dashboard. \n \n \n login to the dashboard at Cloud Dashboard\
          \ \n \n \n Go to Dashboard Images tab \n \n \n For advanced users, you can\
          \ also create your own images. Please refer to\nopenstack documentation\
          \ for more details. \n Configure Instance \n Before you can launch a instance,\
          \ you need to configure the below options: \n Details \n \n \n Instance\
          \ Name: your choice of name for the instance to reference in future \n \n\
          \ \n Flavour: the specification of the instance. It gives your number of\
          \ VCPUs,\n size of root disk, size of ephemeral disk and size of RAM. Your\
          \ allocated\n flavour or lesser configurations can be selected (the default\
          \ is m1.small a 1\n CPU machine) \n \n \n Instance Count: number of instance\
          \ to launch (the default is 1) \n \n \n Instance Boot Source: the media\
          \ used to boot the instance. you can boot from\n image, snapshot and volume(the\
          \ default is boot from image) \n \n \n Boot from image: Boot instance using\
          \ an image \n \n \n Boot from snapshot: Boot instance using an snapshot\
          \ \n \n \n Boot from volume: Boot instance from volume storage \n \n \n\
          \ Image Name: the name of an Image. This option depends on instance boot\
          \ source \n \n \n Access & Security \n \n \n Key Pair: the public/private\
          \ keys used to log into the instance. See above to\n see how to create them\
          \ \n \n \n Security Groups: add network access to your instances. This determines\
          \ what\n services can be accessed on the instance. You must select 'SSH'\
          \ Security Groups\n to allow you to login via SSH. If 'SSH' Security Groups\
          \ is not available, you\n can create it by going to Access $ Security tab\
          \ on the right hand side of the\n Cloud Dashboard. The default Security\
          \ Group (no network access at first) is\n pre-selected \n \n \n To create\
          \ a Security Group: \n \n \n login to the dashboard at Cloud Dashboard \n\
          \ \n \n Go to Access & Security tab \n \n \n Click 'Create Security Group'\
          \ button \n \n \n Give a name for the Security Group \n \n \n Give a meaningful\
          \ description for the Security Group \n \n \n Click 'Create Security Group'\
          \ button \n \n \n The newly created Security Group has no rules added(no\
          \ network access defined).\nTo add rules to a Security Group: \n \n \n Go\
          \ to Access $ Security tab \n \n \n Tick to select the Security Group to\
          \ add rules \n \n \n Click 'Manage Rules' button \n \n \n Click 'Add Rule'\
          \ button \n \n \n Select what type of Rule you want to create \n \n \n Select\
          \ Open Port 'Port' to open one single port, Select Open Port 'Port Range'\n\
          \ to open a range of ports \n \n \n Select remote. You specify the source\
          \ of the traffic to be allowed via this\n rule. You may do so either in\
          \ the form of an IP address block (CIDR) or via a\n source group (Security\
          \ Group). \n \n \n Click 'Add' button \n \n \n You can also click 'Delete\
          \ Rule' button to delete a rule \n Availability Zone \n Select the Availability\
          \ Zone for your instance. The Availability Zone is the\nlocation for your\
          \ instance. By default, the system will select an available\nlocation for\
          \ you. You can also click the 'Advanced' button to select a complete\nlist\
          \ of available Availability Zones \n Post-Creation \n You can execute a\
          \ customization script after you launch your instance. You can\ndo any initialization\
          \ and customization to your instance by using this and it\nis executed only\
          \ once at the first boot of your instance. You can copy/paste\nyour script\
          \ by selecting 'Direct Input' or you can upload a script file. The\nscript\
          \ can be shell script or Cloud-init script. \n Advanced Options \n You can\
          \ choose whether you automatic or manual create disk partition. In most\n\
          cases, you shouldn't change the default. \n Notes:\nThe above configuration\
          \ options can be set in the 'Launch Instance' popup\nwindow. To launch the\
          \ popup window, you can to go Dashboard Instances tab and\nclick 'Launch\
          \ Instance' button. \n To get more information about the terms used, please\
          \ refer to\nglossary. \n Launch Instance \n \n \n login to the dashboard\
          \ at Cloud Dashboard \n \n \n Go to Dashboard Instances tab \n \n \n Click\
          \ 'Launch Instance' button \n \n \n Type instance name \n \n \n Select a\
          \ flavour. Flavour indicates the specification of a instance. You can\n\
          \ find more information in the Flavour Details. \n \n \n Select an NeCTAR\
          \ offical image (we suggest selecting a Ubuntu image such as\n NeCTAR Ubuntu\
          \ 14.10 (Utopic) amd64) \n \n \n Click Access & Security tab \n \n \n Select\
          \ a key pair created earlier \n \n \n Select security groups to use. Tick\
          \ 'ssh' and 'http' (these are pre-defined\n group) \n \n \n Click AVailability\
          \ Zone \n \n \n Select the location of your instance or leave as unselected(the\
          \ system will\n auto select available location) \n \n \n Click launch button\
          \ and the page will change to the Instances Tab \n \n \n After a while(usually\
          \ a couple of minutes), your instance will become active\n and will have\
          \ an IP address. The IP address is available in the Instances table \n \n\
          \ \n The launch button begins Cloud provisioning and initialisation of a\
          \ running\ninstance from the selected image and your configuration options.\
          \ The instance\nwill normally pass from status \"Build\" to \"Active\".\
          \ Depending on your image\nsize and cloud activity, the length of time required\
          \ may vary, refresh your\nbrowser to see the status change. Your instance\
          \ will have a public IP address\nand be reachable according to the Security\
          \ Groups selected. \n You can connect to your new instance via\nAccessing\
          \ Your Instance \n If Launch is Unsuccessful \n You may get a message that\
          \ you your quota has been exceeded or you have\ninsufficient resources.\
          \ Check the table to the right on the Launch Instance page\nit lists the\
          \ number of instances you may run simultaneously, then check the\nInstances\
          \ tab to see how many Instances you already have running. You may have\n\
          to terminate a running Instance to free resources before you can launch\
          \ another\n(see Instance tab to Terminate). If you need more resources see\
