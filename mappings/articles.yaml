        desc_un_html: " Heat is a template driven service that automates the management\
          \ of the entire\nlifecycle of your application on the NeCTAR cloud. \n A\
          \ 'template driven service' simply means that you define your application's\n\
          requirements in a human readable text file - the template. In this file\
          \ you to\ndescribe both the infrastructure and its relationships that your\
          \ application\nwill need to run on the NeCTAR cloud. \n Heat then uses this\
          \ template to provision the required infrastructure and\nmanage the lifecycle\
          \ of your application from start to finish. This template,\nand the infrastructure\
          \ that it has created, is termed a 'stack'. \n As part of the life cycle\
          \ management, the Heat service supports both scaling\non demand and the\
          \ freeing up of infrastructure once the application is\nfinished. \n Heat\
          \ integrates well with configuration management tools, such as Chef and\n\
          Puppet. Thus the Heat service offers executable documentation of your\n\
          application's deployment and lifecycle, making your deployments repeatable\
          \ and\nreliable. The net effect is to limit human error and to save you\
          \ time. Thus\nsaving you money. \n The stack template format(s) \n Heat\
          \ is modelled after Amazon's CloudFormation service, and\nendeavours to\
          \ maintain some degree of comparability with this service. Hence\nHeat supports\
          \ two different template formats. \n \n The first is a JSON based implementation\
          \ that mimics the Amazon specification. \n The second is a YAML based native\
          \ OpenStack implementation. \n \n The stack lifecycle \n A template is created,\
          \ using a standard text editor (such as Notepad++). It is then uploaded\
          \ into the OpenStack Heat\nservice, either by means of the Heat command\
          \ line client, or the Horizon\ndashboard. \n If uploaded via the command\
          \ line client, the engine expects any mandatory\nparameters to be provided\
          \ as arguments added at the point the template was\nuploaded. \n If, however,\
          \ uploaded via the dashboard, then the dashboard will create an\ninput wizard\
          \ that will step the person who uploaded the template through the\nprocess\
          \ of entering the required parameter values. \n Once all the required data\
          \ has been gathered the stack is then provisioned and\nlaunched. \n The\
          \ template and its associated parameters will remain in the Heat database\n\
          until such time as the engine is instructed to destroy the stack. \n At\
          \ that point all the provisioned infrastructure will be destroyed, its\n\
          resources released, and then the template and its parameters will be removed\n\
          from the Heat database. \n We have created a screencast that that does a\
          \ walk through of this lifecycle:\nHeat: a screencast. \n More information\
          \ \n The following pages offer more in depth technical information on using\
          \ Heat in\nthe NeCTAR cloud. \n \n \nHeat: enough YAML to read a template\
          \ (usefull if you don't know YAML) \n \nHeat: walk through of a YAML template\
          \ - a walk through of a Heat template that is in use on the NeCTAR cloud.\

          \ \n \n AWS::CloudFormation::WaitConditionHandle \n OS::Heat::HARestarter\
          \ \n AWS::AutoScaling::ScalingPolicy \n AWS::IAM::User \n \n This is a known\
          \ issue and should be resolved in the next release of OpenStack. \n No root\
          \ certificates message \n If you get an error stating that \"No root certificates\
          \ specified for\nverification of other-side certificates\" when using the\
          \ command line then the\nwork around is to use the --insecure flag: \n heat\
          \ --insecure stack-list \n This stops the server's certificate from being\
          \ verified against any certficate\nauthority. Not the greatest solution,\
          \ but a solution for the time being. "

          requirements in a human readable text file - the template. In this file
          you to

          describe both the infrastructure and its relationships that your application

          will need to run on the NeCTAR cloud.</p>

          <p>Heat then uses this template to provision the required infrastructure
          and

          manage the lifecycle of your application from start to finish. This template,

          and the infrastructure that it has created, is termed a ''stack''.</p>

          <p>As part of the life cycle management, the Heat service supports both
          scaling

          on demand and the freeing up of infrastructure once the application is

          finished.</p>

          <p>Heat integrates well with configuration management tools, such as Chef
          and

          Puppet. Thus the Heat service offers executable documentation of your

          application''s deployment and lifecycle, making your deployments repeatable
          and

          reliable. The net effect is to limit human error and to save you time. Thus

          saving you money.</p>

          <h2>The stack template format(s)</h2>

          <p>Heat is modelled after Amazon''s <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AW%0ASCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html?r=7078">CloudFormation</a>
          service, and

          endeavours to maintain some degree of comparability with this service. Hence

          Heat supports two different template formats.</p>

          <ul>

          <li>The first is a <a href="http://www.json.org/">JSON</a> based implementation
          that mimics the Amazon specification.</li>

          <li>The second is a <a href="http://www.yaml.org/">YAML</a> based native
          OpenStack implementation.</li>

          </ul>

          <h2>The stack lifecycle</h2>

          <p>A template is created, using a standard text editor (such as <a>Notepad++</a>).
          It is then uploaded into the OpenStack Heat

          service, either by means of the Heat command line client, or the Horizon

          dashboard.</p>

          <p>If uploaded via the command line client, the engine expects any mandatory

          parameters to be provided as arguments added at the point the template was

          uploaded.</p>

          <p>If, however, uploaded via the dashboard, then the dashboard will create
          an

          input wizard that will step the person who uploaded the template through
          the

          process of entering the required parameter values.</p>

          <p>Once all the required data has been gathered the stack is then provisioned
          and

          launched.</p>

          <p>The template and its associated parameters will remain in the Heat database

          until such time as the engine is instructed to destroy the stack.</p>

          <p>At that point all the provisioned infrastructure will be destroyed, its

          resources released, and then the template and its parameters will be removed

          from the Heat database.</p>

          <p>We have created a screencast that that does a walk through of this lifecycle:
