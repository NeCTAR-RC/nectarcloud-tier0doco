          \ a Security Group \n Example - launching an instance \n \n This guide describes\
          \ launching a running instance (virtual machine) with SSH login\nenabled.\
          \ \n Setting up and using the Virtual Machines requires at least some familiarity\
          \ with\nUNIX shell (often called 'BASH') commands. There are many excellent\
          \ beginner's \ntutorials to refresh your skills, such as this short, interactive\
          \ tutorial from\nCodecademy. \n Preparation - creating an SSH keypair \n\
          \ \n You need to create a public/private key pair before you can use SSH\
          \ to login to \nthe newly created instance. The public key will be stored\
          \ on the instance and\nthe private key is used on your desktop/laptop. \
          \ \n \n Keys can be created by your computer, and the public key uploaded\
          \ to Nectar, or  \n Keys can be created on the Nectar dashboard, and the\
          \ private key downloaded to your computer. \n \n 1. Create a keypair locally\
          \ \n Windows User \n On Windows computers, the program PuTTY is used as\
          \ an SSH client and a terminal emulator.\nPutty allows the windows user\
          \ to access and use the VM via the command line.\nUse PuTTYgen key generator\
          \ to generate the required key pair: \n \n \n Download PuTTYgen (puttygen.exe)\
          \ from PuTTYgen download page\n \n Launch the PuTTYgen application by double\
          \ clicking the puttygen.exe\n \n The default settings are fine for this\
          \ case, click the 'Generate' button \n Save your public key by clicking\
          \ 'Save public key' button. You should give a\n name that will help identify\
          \ the key in the future \n Save your private key by clicking 'Save private\
          \ key' button. You should give\n a sensible name for future reference. The\
          \ passphrase can provide additional\n security, though can be left empty.\
          \ \n \n \n Linux/Mac User \n On Mac and Linux computers, commands are entered\
          \ directly in the 'Terminal' application. \n ssh-keygen -t rsa -f Nectar_Key\
          \ \n \n To generate a keypair, enter the previous command in the Terminal.\
          \ \n Instead of \"Nectar_Key\", enter your preferred key name. \n By default,\
          \ key files will be generated in the directory '~/.ssh'. Check with ls ~/.ssh\n\
          \ \n You should see a private key (e.g. 'Nectar_Key') and a public key (e.g.\
          \ 'Nectar_Key.pub') \n \n Note: For the security of your private key, ensuring\
          \ only the user can read the file:\nOn you local computer, enter chmod 600\
          \ ~/.ssh/Nectar_Key. \n \n Import the Public Key to Nectar \n The public\
          \ key generated by Windows/Linux/Mac are required to be imported into\n\
          the Nectar Cloud dashboard before use. \n \n   \n \n Log into the Cloud\
          \ Dashboard\n \n Go to the 'Access and Security' tab and then to the 'Keypairs'\
          \ page \n Click 'Import Key Pair' button \n \n Type in a keypair name and\
          \ paste the contents of the public key.  \n \n \n For Windows users, open\
          \ PuTTYgen and click 'Load' button to load the related private key and copy/paste\
          \ the public key contents. \n \n For Linux/Mac user, type cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\
          \ and copy/paste the public key contents from the terminal output. \n \n\
          \ 2. Alternatively: Create Keys on the Nectar Cloud Dashboard \n \n \n Login\
          \ to the Cloud Dashboard\n \n Go to the Access and Security tab and then\
          \ to the Keypairs page \n Click the 'Create Key Pair' button \n Type in\
          \ a keypair name in the popup window and click the 'Create Key Pair'\n button.\
          \ The private key will be downloaded. \n Save the private key into a directory\
          \ on your local computer. \n \n \n Mac / Linux \n mv ~/Downloads/Nectar_Key.pem\
          \ ~/.ssh/Nectar_Key This moves the private key to \nthe '.ssh' folder (change\
          \ 'Nectar_Key' to the name of your keypair). \n Note: For the security of\
          \ your private key, ensuring only the user can read the file:\nOn you local\
          \ computer, enter chmod 600 ~/.ssh/Nectar_Key.  \n \n Windows \n The SSH\
          \ private key will need to be converted for use with PuTTY. \n \n Open PuTTYgen\
          \ \n Click 'Load' button to load the private key generated by the Cloud\
          \ Dashboard \n Click 'Export OpenSSH key' from 'Conversions' menu \n Type\
          \ a private key name and save \n \n   \n \n For more information, you can\
          \ access the detailed SSH key tutorial page. \n \n Select an Image \n You\
          \ need to select an image to be used for your instance. The image defines\
          \ what\noperating system the instance uses and thus you need to select an\
          \ image based on\nyour needs. Nectar Cloud offers a list of official images\
          \ and for\nsimplicity, these images are recommended. You can find a complete\
          \ list of\nofficial images from Nectar image catalog. You can also find\
          \ all\navailable images from the Cloud Dashboard. \n \n Login to the Cloud\
          \ Dashboard\n \n Go to the Dashboard 'Images' tab \n \n For advanced users,\
          \ you can also create your own images. Please refer to\nthe openstack documentation\
          \ for more details. \n Configure Instance \n \n Before you can launch an\
          \ instance, you need to configure the following options: \n Details \n \n\
          \ \n Instance Name: the name used by the dashboard to identify the instance\
          \ \n \n \n Flavour: the resources available for the instance. It specifies\
          \ the number of\n VCPUs, size of root disk, size of ephemeral disk and size\
          \ of RAM.\n Your allocated flavour or lesser configurations can be selected\
          \ (the\n default is m2.tiny; a 1 VCPU machine) \n \n \n Instance Count:\
          \ number of instance to launch (the default is 1) \n \n \n Instance Boot\
          \ Source: the media used to boot the instance. You can boot from\n image,\
          \ snapshot and volume (the default is boot from image) \n \n \n Boot from\
          \ image: Boot instance using an image \n \n Boot from snapshot: Boot instance\
          \ using a snapshot \n \n Boot from volume: Boot instance from volume storage\
          \ \n \n \n Image Name: the name of an Image. This option is used when the\
          \ Instance Boot\n Source is 'Boot from image' \n \n \n Access & Security\
          \ \n \n \n Key Pair: the public/private keys used to log into the instance.\
          \ See above to\n see how to create them. This can't be added or changed\
          \ after the instance is\n created. \n \n \n Security Groups: add network\
          \ access to your instances. This determines what\n services can be accessed\
          \ on the instance. You must select 'SSH' Security Groups\n to allow you\
          \ to login via SSH. If 'SSH' Security Groups is not available, you\n can\
          \ create it by going to Access & Security tab on the right hand side of\
          \ the\n Cloud Dashboard. The default Security Group (no network access at\
          \ first) is\n pre-selected \n \n \n To create a Security Group \n \n \n\
          \ Login to the Cloud Dashboard\n \n Go to the Access & Security tab \n Click\
          \ 'Create Security Group' button \n Give a name for the Security Group \n\
          \ Give a meaningful description for the Security Group \n Click 'Create\
          \ Security Group' button \n \n The newly created Security Group has no rules\
          \ added (no network access defined).\nTo add rules to a Security Group:\
          \ \n \n Go to the Access & Security tab \n Tick to select the Security Group\
          \ to add rules \n Click 'Manage Rules' button \n Click 'Add Rule' button\
          \ \n Select what type of Rule you want to create \n Select from 'Open Port'\
          \ the 'Port' option to open one single port, or 'Port Range'\n to open a\
          \ range of ports \n The 'Remote' option specifies the source of the traffic\
          \ to be allowed via this\n rule. You may do so either in the form of an\
          \ IP address block (CIDR) or via a\n source group (Security Group). \n Click\
          \ 'Add' button \n \n You can also click 'Delete Rule' button to delete a\
          \ rule \n Availability Zone \n Select the Availability Zone for your instance.\
          \ The Availability Zone is the\nlocation for your instance. By default,\
          \ the system will select an available\nlocation for you. You can also click\
          \ the 'Advanced' button to select from a\ncomplete list of available Availability\
          \ Zones \n Post-Creation \n You can execute a customization script after\
          \ you launch your instance. You can\ndo any initialization and customization\
          \ to your instance by using this and it\nis executed only once at the first\
          \ boot of your instance. You can copy/paste\nyour script by selecting 'Direct\
          \ Input' or you can upload a script file. The\nscript can be a shell script\
          \ or Cloud-init script. \n Advanced Options \n You can choose whether you\
          \ automaticly or manually create the disk partition.\nIn most cases, you\
          \ shouldn't change the default. \n Notes: The above configuration options\
          \ can be set in the 'Launch Instance' popup\nwindow. To launch the popup\
          \ window, you can go to the Instances tab and\nclick 'Launch Instance' button.\
          \ \n To get more information about the terms used, please refer to\nthe\
          \ Glossary. \n \n Example Launch of an Instance \n \n \n \n Login to the\
          \ Cloud Dashboard\n \n Go to Dashboard Instances tab \n Click 'Launch Instance'\
          \ button \n Type instance name \n Select a flavour. Flavour indicates the\
          \ specification of a instance. You can find more information in the Flavour\
          \ Details. \n Select an NeCTAR offical image (we suggest selecting an Ubuntu\
          \ image such as NeCTAR Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty) amd64) \n \n \n \n Click Access\
          \ & Security tab \n Select a key pair created earlier \n Select security\
          \ groups to use. Tick 'ssh' and 'http' (these are pre-defined groups in\
          \ the default personal project) \n \n \n \n Click Availability Zone \n Select\
          \ the location of your instance or leave as unselected (the system will\
          \ auto select available location) \n Click launch button and the page will\
          \ change to the Instances Tab \n After a while (usually a couple of minutes),\
          \ your instance will become active\n and will have an IP address. The IP\
          \ address is available in the Instances table\n on your Nectar Dashboard.\
          \ \n \n The launch button begins Cloud provisioning and initialisation of\
          \ a running\ninstance from the selected image and your configuration options.\
          \ The instance\nwill normally pass from status \"Build\" to \"Active\".\
          \ Depending on your image\nsize and cloud activity, the length of time required\
          \ may vary. Your instance\nwill have a public IP address and be reachable\
          \ according to the\nSecurity Groups selected. \n Instructions to access\
          \ the instance are on the 'Accessing Instance' page in Cloud Basics. \n\
          \ If Launch is Unsuccessful \n You may get a message that your quota has\
          \ been exceeded or you have\ninsufficient resources. Check the table to\
          \ the right on the Launch Instance page\nfor the number of instances you\
          \ may run simultaneously, then check the\nInstances tab to see how many\
          \ Instances you already have running. You may have\nto terminate a running\
          \ Instance to free resources before you can launch another\n(see Instance\
          \ tab to Terminate). If you need more resources see the allocation\ntab\
          \ to apply for an increase. \n If the above doesn't apply to you, alternatively,\
          \ you can send an email to the\nCloud Help Desk. Please find how to lodge\
          \ a support ticket from\nNectar Support. "

    \ (virtual machine) with SSH login\nenabled.</p>\n<p>Setting up and using the\
    \ Virtual Machines requires at least some familiarity with\nUNIX shell (often\
    \ called 'BASH') commands. There are many excellent beginner's \ntutorials to\
    \ refresh your skills, such as this short, interactive tutorial from\n<a href=\"\
    https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line\">Codecademy</a>.</p>\n\
    <h2>Preparation - creating an SSH keypair <a name=\"Keypair\"></a></h2>\n<p>You\
    \ need to create a public/private key pair before you can use SSH to login to\
    \ \nthe newly created instance. The public key will be stored on the instance\
    \ and\nthe private key is used on your desktop/laptop. </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Keys can\
    \ be created by your computer, and the public key uploaded to Nectar, or </li>\n\
    <li>Keys can be created on the Nectar dashboard, and the private key downloaded\
    \ to your computer.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>1. Create a keypair locally</h2>\n<h3>Windows\
    \ User</h3>\n<p>On Windows computers, the program PuTTY is used as an SSH client\
    \ and a terminal emulator.\nPutty allows the windows user to access and use the\
    \ VM via the command line.\nUse PuTTYgen key generator to generate the required\
    \ key pair:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"puttygen1\" src=\"https://github.com/NeCTAR-RC/nectarcloud-tier0doco/blob/master/articles/NeCTAR\

    \ page</a></li>\n<li>Launch the PuTTYgen application by double clicking the <code>puttygen.exe</code></li>\n\
    <li>The default settings are fine for this case, click the 'Generate' button</li>\n\
    <li>Save your public key by clicking 'Save public key' button. You should give\
    \ a\n name that will help identify the key in the future</li>\n<li>Save your private\
    \ key by clicking 'Save private key' button. You should give\n a sensible name\
    \ for future reference. The passphrase can provide additional\n security, though\
    \ can be left empty.</li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<h3>Linux/Mac User</h3>\n<p>On Mac and\
    \ Linux computers, commands are entered directly in the 'Terminal' application.</p>\n\
    <p><code>ssh-keygen -t rsa -f Nectar_Key</code></p>\n<ol>\n<li>To generate a keypair,\
    \ enter the previous command in the Terminal.</li>\n<li>Instead of \"Nectar_Key\"\
    , enter your preferred key name.</li>\n<li>By default, key files will be generated\
    \ in the directory '~/.ssh'. Check with <code>ls ~/.ssh</code></li>\n<li>You should\
    \ see a private key (e.g. 'Nectar_Key') and a public key (e.g. 'Nectar_Key.pub')</li>\n\
    </ol>\n<p>Note: For the security of your private key, ensuring only the user can\
    \ read the file:\nOn you local computer, enter <code>chmod 600 ~/.ssh/Nectar_Key</code>.</p>\n\

          \ The Nectar Cloud provides supported computing infrastructure, giving\n\
          researchers access to computing resources without the need to purchase or\
          \ host their own hardware. \nAll Australian researchers have access to the\
          \ Nectar Cloud via the AAF. \n To access the cloud all users must first\
          \ login through the\nNectar Cloud dashboard:\nhttps://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au/\
          \ \n Instances \n Instances running inside the Research Cloud are just like\
          \ real-life machines but\nin a remote location. The Research Cloud is used\
          \ to start, copy and delete\ninstances. They have an operating system (you\
          \ select it from a list), network\naccess (a real IP address & you specify\
          \ any access), and hard disk storage.\nWith no hardware to maintain you\
          \ can copy (Snapshot) and customise new\nmachines rapidly. \n Tools \n The\
          \ Nectar Cloud Dashboard \n The Dashboard provides a web interface to get\
          \ all the basic\nResearch Cloud related jobs done. \n Use the dashboard:\
          \ \n \n for basic Cloud operations: (launching, duplicating & terminating\
          \ ) instances; \n to get Credentials\n  you can use with other API clients;\
          \ \n to make an allocation request for a larger ongoing share of Research\
          \ Cloud Resources. \n \n More about instances \n If you are familiar with\
          \ connecting to remote machines already\nthe same tools and techniques apply\
          \ when connecting to running\ninstances. Your instance has a public IP address\
          \ and, if\nconfigured, can be reached and controlled with any remote\naccess\
          \ tools you wish to use. For example, SSH. \n More information about launching\
          \ and managing instances is here \n Images \n Instances originate from Images\
          \ and can be a plain \"off the\nshelf\" Operating System or include software\
          \ packages and\nconfig changes to suit a particular purpose (e.g.: serving\
          \ web pages).\nThere are publicly available images in the cloud ready for\n\
          you to use. \n To suit your specific purposes an instance may need some\n\
          customisation, configuration changes or software installation.\nIts a good\
          \ idea to make a copy of the instance if you wish to\nre-use its current\
          \ state as a starting point for new instances.\nIf you are experimenting\
          \ and making changes, a copy allows you\nto return to the copied state and\
          \ dispose of the experiment\nwithout having to undo/redo configuration changes.\
          \ \n You can create an Image from scratch, but usually its easier\nto customise\
          \ & copy a running instance that is close\nto what you need. \n Copies of\
          \ instances are called Snapshots and can be used\nlike other Images to start\
          \ new instances. Making a Snapshot\nis simple: \n \n Go to the Dashboard\
          \ \"Instances\" \n   tab; \n Click \"Create Snapshot\" for the running instance\
          \ you wish to copy. \n \n Key Pairs \n Key pairs enable you to communicate\
          \ with your instance via\nSSH. When launching an instance you specify an\
          \ existing key\npair. The public key is injected into the running\ninstance's\
          \ authorized_keys file. \n You can manage your key pairs through the Dashboard\
          \ or via\nthe nova CLI client. \n In the dashboard under the Access & Security\n\
          tab you can manage your keys. You have the option of: \n \n Importing an\
          \ existing SSH key you own; \n Creating a new SSH Key. \n \n Important:\
          \ Key pairs can only be specified on instance\ncreation, if you don't specify\
          \ a keypair on creation you will\nnot be able to add it later. \n Security\
          \ groups \n Incoming network access to your machines is usually required.\n\
          Security Groups are how to add network access. If you can't\nreach your\
          \ instance by SSH to login or by browser if it\nruns a web server additional\
          \ Security Group settings could be\nneeded. \n The OpenStack article title\
          \ \"Security Groups\"\ngives more information. \n Storage in the cloud \n\
          \ The NeCTAR Research Cloud provides instances for research\nuse. While\
          \ resources like processing cores, RAM and the\namount of storage you get\
          \ are dedicated to a particular\ninstance, other resources like the network\
          \ and the underlying\nstorage system are shared among instances. Furthermore,\
          \ not\nall storage is created equal, the Research Cloud offers: \n \n \n\
          Object storage; \n \nBlock storage; \n Transient/Ephemeral storage. \n \n\
          \ You can decide which suits your needs best by reading the OpenStack article\n\
          titled \"Storage Decisions\" "

    http://nectar.org.au/\">Nectar</a> (National eResearch Collaboration Tools and\
    \ Resources) is an\nAustralian Government project funded to build new infrastructure\
    \ specifically for the needs of\nAustralian researchers. The Nectar Cloud provides\
    \ supported computing infrastructure, giving\nresearchers access to computing\
    \ resources without the need to purchase or host their own hardware.<br>\nAll\
    \ Australian researchers have access to the Nectar Cloud via the <a href=\"http://support.rc.nectar.org.au/node/111\"\
    >AAF</a>.</p>\n<p>To access the cloud all users must first login through the\n\
    Nectar Cloud dashboard:\n<a href=\"https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au/\">https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au/</a></p>\n\
    <h2>Instances</h2>\n<p>Instances running inside the Research Cloud are just like\
    \ real-life machines but\nin a remote location. The Research Cloud is used to\
    \ start, copy and delete\ninstances. They have an operating system (you select\
    \ it from a list), network\naccess (a real IP address &amp; you specify any access),\
    \ and hard disk storage.\nWith no hardware to maintain you can copy (Snapshot)\
    \ and customise new\nmachines rapidly.</p>\n<h2>Tools</h2>\n<h3>The Nectar Cloud\
    \ Dashboard</h3>\n<p>The Dashboard provides a web interface to get all the basic\n\
    Research Cloud related jobs done.</p>\n<p>Use the dashboard:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>for\
    \ basic Cloud operations: (launching, duplicating &amp; terminating ) instances;</li>\n\
    <li>to get <a href=\"https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au/project/access_and_security/\"\
    >Credentials</a>\n  you can use with other <a href=\"http://docs.openstack.org/cli-reference/content/ch_cli.html\"\
    >API clients</a>;</li>\n<li>to make an allocation request for a larger ongoing\
    \ share of Research Cloud Resources.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>More about instances</h3>\n\
    <p>If you are familiar with connecting to remote machines already\nthe same tools\
    \ and techniques apply when connecting to running\ninstances. Your instance has\
    \ a public IP address and, if\nconfigured, can be reached and controlled with\
    \ any remote\naccess tools you wish to use. For example, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell\"\
    >SSH</a>.</p>\n<p>More information about launching and managing instances is <a\
    \ href=\"https://support.nectar.org.au/support/solutions/articles/6000073471-introduction-to-instance-management\"\
    >here</a></p>\n<h3>Images</h3>\n<p>Instances originate from Images and can be\
    \ a plain \"off the\nshelf\" Operating System or include software packages and\n\
    config changes to suit a particular purpose (e.g.: serving web pages).\nThere\
    \ are publicly available images in the cloud ready for\nyou to use.</p>\n<p>To\
    \ suit your specific purposes an instance may need some\ncustomisation, configuration\
    \ changes or software installation.\nIts a good idea to make a copy of the instance\
    \ if you wish to\nre-use its current state as a starting point for new instances.\n\
    If you are experimenting and making changes, a copy allows you\nto return to the\
    \ copied state and dispose of the experiment\nwithout having to undo/redo configuration\
    \ changes.</p>\n<p>You can create an Image from scratch, but usually its easier\n\
    to customise &amp; copy a running instance that is close\nto what you need.</p>\n\
    <p>Copies of instances are called Snapshots and can be used\nlike other Images\
    \ to start new instances. Making a Snapshot\nis simple:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to the\
    \ Dashboard \"<a href=\"https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au/project/instances/\"\
    >Instances</a>\" \n   tab;</li>\n<li>Click \"Create Snapshot\" for the running\
    \ instance you wish to copy.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Key Pairs</h2>\n<p>Key pairs enable\
    \ you to communicate with your instance via\nSSH. When launching an instance you\
    \ specify an existing key\npair. The public key is injected into the running\n\
    instance's authorized_keys file.</p>\n<p>You can manage your key pairs through\

    <h2>What should I do when I am finished with an instance</h2>

    <p>When you are finished with an Instance, you should terminate it.  Leaving an

    instance running, or in "paused" or "suspended" or "shutdown" states is tying

    down resources that other people could be using.</p>

    <p>Note that terminating an instance destroys its primary and ephemeral file

    systems.  If you want to save the primary file system (so that you can launch
    a

    new instance), snapshot the instance before you terminate it.</p>'

          \ them in order for it\nto function properly. Among these resources, storage\
          \ is the fundamental component\nfor both the virtual machine and user to\
          \ save and use data. The amount of\nstorage your virtual machine get are\
          \ dedicated, but the underlying storage\nsystem are shared. Furthermore,\
          \ not all storage is created equal, and Research\nCloud users have a few\
          \ different types of storage available which differ\naccording to performance,\
          \ persistence and data safety. \n On Virtual Machine Storage \n Each virtual\
          \ machine in the NeCTAR Cloud comes with a certain amount of built-in\n\
          storage and theseappear as two separated hard disks\n(Root Disk and Ephemeral\
          \ Disk). These storage disks run off robust\nenterprise-grade storage hardware\
          \ on the back. However, both storage disks are not\nsuitable for long-term\
          \ persistent data as data will be lost after termination or\nrebuild of\
          \ a virtual machine. \n Root Disk \n This storage is used for the operating\
          \ system of the virtual machine, to boot it\ninto a functional state. It\
          \ has a limited 10GB in size, which is the same for every\nstandard size\
          \ of virtual machine (Small, Medium, Large, Extra Large and\nExtra Extra\
          \ Large). The size varies for non-standard virtual machines such as\ntiny,\
          \ which only has 5GB root storage. \n Data stored on the root storage are\
          \ persistent until the termination or rebuild\nof the virtual machine and\
          \ are copied during the snapshot. That means, if you\nreboot your virtual\
          \ machine, the data remains intact and when you take a\npoint-in-time snapshot\
          \ of your virtual machine, the entire root storage is\ncopied. As the root\
          \ storage comes with fixed size and is used by the operation\nsystem, caution\
          \ need to be taken as it should not be filled in full. The name of\nthis\
          \ disk as seen from the virtual machine is usually '/dev/vda'. \n Ephemeral\
          \ Disk \n This storage appears as a second hard disk in your virtual machine.\
          \ It is a raw\nand unformatted block device, that you can format and use\
          \ as you wish. It varies\nin size according to the size of virtual machine\
          \ (from 0GB to 480GB). For each\nCPU, a standard virtual machine will get\
          \ 30GB of additional ephemeral storage.\nIt varies in size for non-standard\
          \ virtual machines. The name of this device as\nseen from the instance is\
          \ usually '/dev/vdb' and some operating systems will\nautomatically format\
          \ and mount the ephemeral disk. For example, Ubuntu creates\nan ext3 partition\
          \ and mounts it at '/mnt'. For operating systems that don't do it\nautomatically,\
          \ you can format it by executing mkfs.ext4 /dev/vdb in the command line\n\
          and mount it by executing mount /dev/vdb /mnt. You need to have root\npermission\
          \ to do this. \n Data stored on ephemeral disk are only persistent until\
          \ the termination or\nrebuild of the virtual machine (like the root disk).\
          \ The only difference\nis that data on the ephemeral disk are not copied\

          Your data on a persistent volume are retained even when you terminate your\n\
          virtual machine. Persistent Volumes offer a snapshot feature which can be\
          \ used\nto make convenient backups (this uses some of your overall Persistent\
          \ Volume quota). \n NOTE: Persistent Volumes are local services and only\
          \ virtual machines in the\navailability zone where the persistent Volume\

          \ \n By default, there are no persistent volume storage available to your\
          \ project.\nYou need to make an allocation request to apply for the quantity\
          \ of persistent volume\nstorage you require for your project. Follow these\
          \ steps to submit a\nrequest: \n \n \n Login to NeCTAR Cloud Dashboard \n\
          \ \n \n Go to Allocations and you can either click 'New Request' to make\
          \ a new request\n or 'My Requests' to amend an existing request \n \n \n\
          \ Under section 'Storage Quota', you select 'Resource' as volume, select\
          \ the\n Zone you want the storage to be located at (must be the same location\
          \ as the instance it will be attached to) and enter the size in GB under\
          \ 'Requested Quota'. \n \n \n Click the 'Submit' button \n \n \n NOTE: It\
          \ may take a while for your request to be approved. \n Create a persistent\
          \ volume storage \n Once your request has been approved, your project should\
          \ have volume storage\navailable. You need to create the volume storage\
          \ in the NeCTAR Cloud Dashboard \nbefore you can use it. \n \n \n Login\
          \ to the NeCTAR Cloud Dashboard \n \n \n Go to 'Volumes' \n \n \n Click\
          \ 'Create Volume' button \n \n \n Give a Volume Name and meaningful description\
          \ \n \n \n Specify a 'Volume Source' to determine how the volume will be\
          \ built. You can select\n 'No source empty volume' to create new empty volume.\
          \ You can select 'image' to\n build a volume from a image or 'Volume' to\
          \ build a volume from existing volume \n \n \n Specify the size of the volume\
          \ in GB \n \n \n Enter an 'Availability Zone' (must be the same zone as\
          \ the instance) \n \n \n Click 'Create Volume' button \n \n \n Attach a\
          \ persistent volume storage \n You can attach the volume created earlier\
          \ to a running virtual machine. See the\nbelow instruction: \n \n \n Login\

          \ Volume Storage in Virtual Machine \n For a standard flavor virtual machine\
          \ the persistent volume will be attached\nas '/dev/vdc'.  \n A new volume\
          \ may not have a file system (depending on how it was created) and\nyou\

          \ is dependent on the virtual machine' operating\nsystem and the type of\
          \ file system you require. \n You can use below command to create file system\
          \ on the new volume:\nsudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/vdc \n WARNING: This can cause\
          \ data loss if a file system already exists on the target\nVolume. \n You\
          \ can use below command to mount the volume (choose any volume-name). \n\
          \ sudo mkdir /volume_name \n sudo mount /dev/vdc /volume_name -t auto \n\
          \ NOTE: At first, you will not be able to save information to the ephemeral\
          \ disk. \nThe following command gives permission for the user 'ubuntu' to\
          \ write to the ephemeral disk: \n sudo chown ubuntu /mnt \n Notes:\nVolumes\
          \ must be detached before deletion. \n Check your Storage \n Here are some\
          \ commands that can allow you to look at your mounted storage blocks\nand\
          \ keep track of their usage: \n lsblk -l  for info : man lsblk \n df -hT\
          \  for info : man df \n du -h <path/to/directory>  for info : man du \n\
          \ Object Storage \n The NeCTAR Cloud Object Storage is not a traditional\
          \ file system, but rather a\ndistributed storage system for static data\
          \ such as virtual machine images,\nphoto storage, email storage, backups\
          \ and archives. Having no central \"brain\" or\nmaster point of control\
          \ provides greater scalability, redundancy and durability.\nWhen you put\
          \ a file in the NeCTAR Cloud Object Store, 3 copies of your data are\ndistributed\
          \ to different hardware for extra data safety and performance. \n Think\
          \ about that dataset comprised of 2GB files that you read in and analyse\n\
          many times, but in general it doesn't change. Or the images you want to\
          \ use on\nthe cloud. Those are a couple examples of perfect data for Object\
          \ Storage.\nObjects are written to multiple hardware devices in the data\
          \ center to ensure\nintegrity, and great performance! \n In general, the\
          \ object store is great for data you write once and read many\ntimes, but\
          \ not suitable for applications like databases. It's the safest place\n\
          to put your data on the NeCTAR Research Cloud as multiple redundant copies\
          \ of\nyour data are made, and it has great performance. You can access the\
          \ object\nstore from anywhere on the Internet, and data from Object Storage\
          \ can be\ntransferred to and from your virtual machine with a variety of\
          \ http-capable\ntools. \n Object Storage is completely decoupled from your\
          \ virtual machine, so even if you\nreboot, delete or crash your virtual\
          \ machine, your Object Storage files will\nremain safe (unless you remove\
          \ them yourself). Object Storage persists\nindependently of the life of\
          \ an instance. \n Swift \n Swift is the component that provides object storage\
          \ for OpenStack. With your\ncredentials and via a URL you can request Swift\
          \ to reserve & create storage\n(called containers or buckets). Files (known\
          \ as objects when stored in Swift)\ncan then be uploaded and accessed similarly\
          \ by your running virtual machines. \n The NeCTAR implementation of Swift\
          \ is geodistributed across Nodes of the NeCTAR\nCloud so that availability\
          \ does not rely on any one data center or network\ninfrastructure. Each\
          \ collection of Swift nodes/hardware is known as a region,\nwhich may or\
          \ may not include a Swift proxy server (the Internet facing and\nserving\
          \ component of Swift). With some Swift clients/APIs users can explicitly\n\
          chose which proxy to connect to, this might be useful e.g. for speeding\
          \ up\nwrites to object storage by choosing the nearest proxy. Due to NeCTAR's\
          \ Swift\nhaving multiple regions (some of which are Node private) some clients/APIs\n\
          require explicit configuration of a default region, which should be \"Melbourne\"\
          \nfor most users. "
        description: "<p>The NeCTAR virtual machines have many resources binded with\
          \ them in order for it\nto function properly. Among these resources, storage\
          \ is the fundamental component\nfor both the virtual machine and user to\
          \ save and use data. The amount of\nstorage your virtual machine get are\
          \ dedicated, but the underlying storage\nsystem are shared. Furthermore,\
          \ not all storage is created equal, and Research\nCloud users have a few\
          \ different types of storage available which differ\naccording to performance,\
          \ persistence and data safety.</p>\n<h2>On Virtual Machine Storage</h2>\n\
          <p>Each virtual machine in the NeCTAR Cloud comes with a certain amount\
          \ of built-in\nstorage and theseappear as two separated hard disks\n(Root\
          \ Disk and Ephemeral Disk). These storage disks run off robust\nenterprise-grade\
          \ storage hardware on the back. However, both storage disks are not\nsuitable\
          \ for long-term persistent data as data will be lost after termination or\n\
          rebuild of a virtual machine.</p>\n<h3>Root Disk</h3>\n<p>This storage is\
          \ used for the operating system of the virtual machine, to boot it\ninto\
          \ a functional state. It has a limited 10GB in size, which is the same for\
          \ every\nstandard size of virtual machine (Small, Medium, Large, Extra Large\
          \ and\nExtra Extra Large). The size varies for non-standard virtual machines\
          \ such as\ntiny, which only has 5GB root storage.</p>\n<p>Data stored on\
          \ the root storage are persistent until the termination or rebuild\nof the\
          \ virtual machine and are copied during the snapshot. That means, if you\n\
          reboot your virtual machine, the data remains intact and when you take a\n\
          point-in-time snapshot of your virtual machine, the entire root storage\
          \ is\ncopied. As the root storage comes with fixed size and is used by the\
          \ operation\nsystem, caution need to be taken as it should not be filled\
          \ in full. The name of\nthis disk as seen from the virtual machine is usually\
          \ '/dev/vda'.</p>\n<h3>Ephemeral Disk</h3>\n<p>This storage appears as a\
          \ second hard disk in your virtual machine. It is a raw\nand unformatted\
          \ block device, that you can format and use as you wish. It varies\nin size\
          \ according to the size of virtual machine (from 0GB to 480GB). For each\n\
          CPU, a standard virtual machine will get 30GB of additional ephemeral storage.\n\
          It varies in size for non-standard virtual machines. The name of this device\
          \ as\nseen from the instance is usually '/dev/vdb' and some operating systems\
          \ will\nautomatically format and mount the ephemeral disk. For example,\
          \ Ubuntu creates\nan ext3 partition and mounts it at '/mnt'. For operating\
          \ systems that don't do it\nautomatically, you can format it by executing\
          \ <code>mkfs.ext4 /dev/vdb</code> in the command line\nand mount it by executing\
          \ <code>mount /dev/vdb /mnt</code>. You need to have root\npermission to\
          \ do this.</p>\n<p>Data stored on ephemeral disk are only persistent until\
          \ the termination or\nrebuild of the virtual machine (like the root disk).\

  html: "<p>The NeCTAR virtual machines have many resources binded with them in order\
    \ for it\nto function properly. Among these resources, storage is the fundamental\
    \ component\nfor both the virtual machine and user to save and use data. The amount\
    \ of\nstorage your virtual machine get are dedicated, but the underlying storage\n\
    system are shared. Furthermore, not all storage is created equal, and Research\n\
    Cloud users have a few different types of storage available which differ\naccording\
    \ to performance, persistence and data safety.</p>\n<h2>On Virtual Machine Storage</h2>\n\
    <p>Each virtual machine in the NeCTAR Cloud comes with a certain amount of built-in\n\
    storage and theseappear as two separated hard disks\n(Root Disk and Ephemeral\
    \ Disk). These storage disks run off robust\nenterprise-grade storage hardware\
    \ on the back. However, both storage disks are not\nsuitable for long-term persistent\
    \ data as data will be lost after termination or\nrebuild of a virtual machine.</p>\n\
    <h3>Root Disk</h3>\n<p>This storage is used for the operating system of the virtual\
    \ machine, to boot it\ninto a functional state. It has a limited 10GB in size,\
    \ which is the same for every\nstandard size of virtual machine (Small, Medium,\
    \ Large, Extra Large and\nExtra Extra Large). The size varies for non-standard\
    \ virtual machines such as\ntiny, which only has 5GB root storage.</p>\n<p>Data\
    \ stored on the root storage are persistent until the termination or rebuild\n\
    of the virtual machine and are copied during the snapshot. That means, if you\n\
    reboot your virtual machine, the data remains intact and when you take a\npoint-in-time\
    \ snapshot of your virtual machine, the entire root storage is\ncopied. As the\
    \ root storage comes with fixed size and is used by the operation\nsystem, caution\
    \ need to be taken as it should not be filled in full. The name of\nthis disk\
    \ as seen from the virtual machine is usually '/dev/vda'.</p>\n<h3>Ephemeral Disk</h3>\n\
    <p>This storage appears as a second hard disk in your virtual machine. It is a\
    \ raw\nand unformatted block device, that you can format and use as you wish.\
    \ It varies\nin size according to the size of virtual machine (from 0GB to 480GB).\
    \ For each\nCPU, a standard virtual machine will get 30GB of additional ephemeral\
    \ storage.\nIt varies in size for non-standard virtual machines. The name of this\
    \ device as\nseen from the instance is usually '/dev/vdb' and some operating systems\
    \ will\nautomatically format and mount the ephemeral disk. For example, Ubuntu\
    \ creates\nan ext3 partition and mounts it at '/mnt'. For operating systems that\
    \ don't do it\nautomatically, you can format it by executing <code>mkfs.ext4 /dev/vdb</code>\
    \ in the command line\nand mount it by executing <code>mount /dev/vdb /mnt</code>.\
    \ You need to have root\npermission to do this.</p>\n<p>Data stored on ephemeral\
    \ disk are only persistent until the termination or\nrebuild of the virtual machine\
    \ (like the root disk). The only difference\nis that data on the ephemeral disk\
    \ are not copied when taking a snapshot of a virtual\nmachine, which means you\
    \ cannot use snapshot to save data stored on ephemeral\ndisk.</p>\n<p>NOTE: At\
    \ first, you will not be able to save information to the ephemeral disk. \nThe\
    \ following command gives permission for the user 'ubuntu' to write to the ephemeral\
    \ disk:</p>\n<p><code>sudo chown ubuntu /mnt</code></p>\n<h4>Backup of Ephemeral\
    \ Disk</h4>\n<p>Data on the ephemeral disk does not get saved in a snapshot, and\
    \ requires other\ntechniques to make a backup. Other forms of storage can be used\
    \ such as the\nObject Store and Volume Storage within the Research Cloud or external\
    \ locations.</p>\n<h2>Persistent Volume Storage</h2>\n<p>Persistent volume storage\
    \ can live outside your virtual machine. It appears\nas block storage which can\
    \ be attached then accessed and even booted from. This\nis a storage volume that\
    \ you can attach to from within your virtual machine,\nread and write data, detach\
    \ it, and make it available to another virtual machine.\nYour data on a persistent\
    \ volume are retained even when you terminate your\nvirtual machine. Persistent\
    \ Volumes offer a snapshot feature which can be used\nto make convenient backups\
    \ (this uses some of your overall Persistent Volume quota).</p>\n<p>NOTE: Persistent\
    \ Volumes are local services and only virtual machines in the\navailability zone\
    \ where the persistent Volume has been created can access it.</p>\n<h3>How to\
    \ Get Persistent Volume Storage</h3>\n<p>By default, there are no persistent volume\
    \ storage available to your project.\nYou need to make an allocation request to\
    \ apply for the quantity of persistent volume\nstorage you require for your project.\
    \ Follow these steps to submit a\nrequest:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Login to NeCTAR\
    \ Cloud <a href=\"https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au\">Dashboard</a></p>\n</li>\n\
    <li>\n<p>Go to Allocations and you can either click 'New Request' to make a new\
    \ request\n or 'My Requests' to amend an existing request</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Under\
    \ section 'Storage Quota', you select 'Resource' as volume, select the\n Zone\
    \ you want the storage to be located at (must be the same location as the instance\
    \ it will be attached to) and enter the size in GB under 'Requested Quota'.</p>\n\
    </li>\n<li>\n<p>Click the 'Submit' button</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>NOTE: It may take\
    \ a while for your request to be approved.</p>\n<h3>Create a persistent volume\
    \ storage</h3>\n<p>Once your request has been approved, your project should have\
    \ volume storage\navailable. You need to create the volume storage in the NeCTAR\
    \ Cloud Dashboard \nbefore you can use it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Login to the NeCTAR\
    \ Cloud <a href=\"https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au\">Dashboard</a></p>\n</li>\n\
    <li>\n<p>Go to 'Volumes'</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click 'Create Volume' button</p>\n\
    </li>\n<li>\n<p>Give a Volume Name and meaningful description</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\
    <p>Specify a 'Volume Source' to determine how the volume will be built. You can\
    \ select\n 'No source empty volume' to create new empty volume. You can select\
    \ 'image' to\n build a volume from a image or 'Volume' to build a volume from\
    \ existing volume</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Specify the size of the volume in GB</p>\n\
    </li>\n<li>\n<p>Enter an 'Availability Zone' (must be the same zone as the instance)</p>\n\
    </li>\n<li>\n<p>Click 'Create Volume' button</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Attach a persistent\
    \ volume storage</h3>\n<p>You can attach the volume created earlier to a running\
    \ virtual machine. See the\nbelow instruction:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Login to NeCTAR\
    \ Cloud <a href=\"https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au\">Dashboard</a></p>\n</li>\n\
    <li>\n<p>Go to 'Volumes'</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click the action list of volume</p>\n\
    </li>\n<li>\n<p>Click 'Edit Attachment'</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click 'Attach to\
    \ Instance' drop down list to select a virtual machine to\n attach the volume\
    \ to.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click 'Attach Volume' button</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Use\
    \ Persistent Volume Storage in Virtual Machine</h3>\n<p>For a standard flavor\
    \ virtual machine the persistent volume will be attached\nas '/dev/vdc'. </p>\n\
    <p>A new volume may not have a file system (depending on how it was created) and\n\
    you need to create one before mounting.</p>\n<p>The exact mount command syntax\
    \ is dependent on the virtual machine' operating\nsystem and the type of file\
    \ system you require.</p>\n<p>You can use below command to create file system\
    \ on the new volume:\n<code>sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/vdc</code></p>\n<p>WARNING: This\
    \ can cause data loss if a file system already exists on the target\nVolume.</p>\n\
    <p>You can use below command to mount the volume (choose any volume-name).</p>\n\
    <p><code>sudo mkdir /volume_name</code></p>\n<p><code>sudo mount /dev/vdc /volume_name\
    \ -t auto</code></p>\n<p>NOTE: At first, you will not be able to save information\
    \ to the ephemeral disk. \nThe following command gives permission for the user\
    \ 'ubuntu' to write to the ephemeral disk:</p>\n<p><code>sudo chown ubuntu /mnt</code></p>\n\
    <p>Notes:\nVolumes must be detached before deletion.</p>\n<h2>Check your Storage</h2>\n\
    <p>Here are some commands that can allow you to look at your mounted storage blocks\n\
    and keep track of their usage:</p>\n<p><code>lsblk -l</code>  for info : <code>man\
    \ lsblk</code></p>\n<p><code>df -hT</code>  for info : <code>man df</code></p>\n\
    <p><code>du -h &lt;path/to/directory&gt;</code>  for info : <code>man du</code></p>\n\
    <h2>Object Storage</h2>\n<p>The NeCTAR Cloud Object Storage is not a traditional\
    \ file system, but rather a\ndistributed storage system for static data such as\
    \ virtual machine images,\nphoto storage, email storage, backups and archives.\
    \ Having no central \"brain\" or\nmaster point of control provides greater scalability,\
    \ redundancy and durability.\nWhen you put a file in the NeCTAR Cloud Object Store,\
    \ 3 copies of your data are\ndistributed to different hardware for extra data\
    \ safety and performance.</p>\n<p>Think about that dataset comprised of 2GB files\
    \ that you read in and analyse\nmany times, but in general it doesn't change.\
    \ Or the images you want to use on\nthe cloud. Those are a couple examples of\
    \ perfect data for Object Storage.\nObjects are written to multiple hardware devices\
    \ in the data center to ensure\nintegrity, and great performance!</p>\n<p>In general,\
    \ the object store is great for data you write once and read many\ntimes, but\
    \ not suitable for applications like databases. It's the safest place\nto put\
    \ your data on the NeCTAR Research Cloud as multiple redundant copies of\nyour\
    \ data are made, and it has great performance. You can access the object\nstore\
    \ from anywhere on the Internet, and data from Object Storage can be\ntransferred\
    \ to and from your virtual machine with a variety of http-capable\ntools.</p>\n\
    <p>Object Storage is completely decoupled from your virtual machine, so even if\
    \ you\nreboot, delete or crash your virtual machine, your Object Storage files\
    \ will\nremain safe (unless you remove them yourself). Object Storage persists\n\
    independently of the life of an instance.</p>\n<h3>Swift</h3>\n<p>Swift is the\
    \ component that provides object storage for OpenStack. With your\ncredentials\
    \ and via a URL you can request Swift to reserve &amp; create storage\n(called\
    \ containers or buckets). Files (known as objects when stored in Swift)\ncan then\
    \ be uploaded and accessed similarly by your running virtual machines.</p>\n<p>The\
    \ NeCTAR implementation of Swift is geodistributed across Nodes of the NeCTAR\n\
    Cloud so that availability does not rely on any one data center or network\ninfrastructure.\
    \ Each collection of Swift nodes/hardware is known as a region,\nwhich may or\
    \ may not include a Swift proxy server (the Internet facing and\nserving component\
    \ of Swift). With some Swift clients/APIs users can explicitly\nchose which proxy\
    \ to connect to, this might be useful e.g. for speeding up\nwrites to object storage\
    \ by choosing the nearest proxy. Due to NeCTAR's Swift\nhaving multiple regions\
    \ (some of which are Node private) some clients/APIs\nrequire explicit configuration\
    \ of a default region, which should be \"Melbourne\"\nfor most users.</p>"

          \ The default Security Group is empty and no incoming access is configured\
          \ until\nyou add rules to specify: \n \n which ports are available for connection\
          \ to your instance and... \n from which addresses your instance will accept\
          \ inbound traffic to the\n  open ports \n \n \n NOTE: If you do not specify\
          \ a security group at boot, the default security\ngroup will be applied\
          \ \n \n \n Each rule adds further access; it never cancels or overrides\
          \ another rule. \n Rules can have overlapping ranges and addresses. \n Rules\
          \ for the same ports and addresses can be added to more than one\n  Security\
          \ Group \n \n Removing Network Access \n To remove access to a port or from\
          \ an address, locate all security groups with\nrules relating to that port\
          \ or address, then \n \n remove or edit each applicable rule, OR \n do not\
          \ apply those Security Groups that contain the applicable rule(s) \n \n\
          \ Pre-Defined and Default Security Groups \n For Project Trials (pt-xxxx)\
          \ there are pre-defined security groups for\nconvenience. \n \n SSH opens\
          \ tcp port 22 to traffic from all sources (for logging via ssh) \n HTTP\
          \ opens tcp ports 80 and 443 to traffic from all sources (for\n  web servers)\
          \ \n ICMP opens all ICMP traffic from all sources (etc. to allow pinging\
          \ your\n  VMs IP address) \n \n For all other shared projects that are created\
          \ after an allocation request,\nthere is only the empty 'default' security\
          \ group at first. These Projects\nshare their security groups so all changes\
          \ should be made with caution as\nthey may affect instances by other users\
          \ sharing your Project. \n Managing Security Groups \n Sometimes it can\
          \ be convenient to organise rules into multiple Security\nGroups,\nfor example\
          \ \n \n apply only some or all groups depending on a instances purpose.\
          \ \n users experimenting with network access can remove groups and re-apply\n\
          \  them without re-creating rules each time \n testing rules on a temporary\
          \ security group and test Instance before\n  adding the same rules to Security\
          \ Groups already in use.\n  Rules can appear in more than one Security Group\
          \ \n \n Applying Security Groups \n Security Groups are most conveniently\
          \ applied before Launching your\ninstance. Multiple security groups can\
          \ be selected.\nSecurity Groups can also be added or removed on running\
          \ instances. \n Click 'Launch' then click the 'Security Groups' field. The\
          \ default group is\npre-selected. \n Outgoing traffic \n Outgoing traffic\
          \ is not blocked on any port:  connections that originate\nfrom your instance\
          \ to the outside world are not blocked by Nectar\nOpenStack configuration\
          \ \n \n Security Note \n Using the Research Cloud creates a publicly accessible\
          \ server (depending on\nSecurity Groups) and therefore that machine can\
          \ be exploited. All users must\nread & follow our Security Guidelines. \n\

          \ terms can be found at: http://docs.openstack.org/glossary/content/glossary.html\
          \ \n The terms \n A \n AAF  - The Australian Access Federation. A\nShibboleth-based\
          \ federated authentication service for the Australian academic community.\n\
          Also the name of the organization that runs the AAF service. \n AARNET -\
          \ Australia's Academic & Research Network - the organization that runs the\n\
          networks connecting Australia's Universities and Research Organizations.\
          \ \n Access Control  - The process of determining if an (authenticated)\
          \ agent is\npermitted to perform some action.  Synonym: Authorization. \n\
          \ Access Group - OpenStack terminology that is a synonym for Security Group.\
          \ \n Access Rule  - An access rule allow network access to an\ninstance\
          \ from other hosts with a specified combination of protocol family (e.g.\
          \ TCP, UDP, UCMP),\nport number and address range. \n Account - OpenStack\
          \ terminology. A synonym for \"project\" and \"tenant\". \n Active Directory\
          \ (AD) - Microsoft's directory service product; essentially LDAP enhanced\
          \ with\nKerberos. Most Microsoft Windows environments will use AD to centrally\
          \ control\nauthentication. \n AMD - Advanced Micro Devices Inc. A manufacturer\
          \ of x86 and x86_64 compatible\nmicroprocessors. A direct competitor to\
          \ Intel. \n API - Application Programming Interface - an interface that\
          \ that is designed for\nprograms to use (As distinct from a user interface,\
          \ which is designed for\npeople to use). \n API Endpoint  - See Service\
          \ endpoint. \n apt  - The package manager used by the Debian\nfamily (Debian/Ubuntu/Mint)\
          \ of Linux distributions. \n Aspera - \"Aspera High-speed File Transfer\
          \ Software that moves the world's data at maximum\nspeed, regardless of\
          \ file size, transfer distance or network conditions\". \n Attach - An OpenStack\
          \ volume can be attached to an OpenStack instance to provide it with\nadditional\
          \ disk storage. \n Authentication - The process of establishing that an\
          \ agent (i.e. a person, or other entity) in a\ncomputer system is who they\
          \ say they are.  The simple username and password\nis the most familiar\
          \ means of authentication. \n Authorization - See Access Control. \n Availability\
          \ Zone (AZ) - a logical grouping of compute nodes within a region. \n AWS\
          \ - Amazon Web Services. \n Azure - Microsoft's commercial cloud computing\

          \ Virtual Laboratory. \n Boot - The boot (or \"bootstrap\") process is the\
          \ means by which the computer starts\nitself up after the power button is\
          \ pressed.  Ultimately booting is the process\nin which a computer goes\
          \ from having empty memory to having the operating\nsystem loaded and running.\
          \ \n Bricked - Colloquialism: describes a system that has been damaged in\
          \ a way that\npermanently locks out some or all functionality.  It's usually\
          \ the consequence\nof some kind of firmware update that fails to run properly,\
          \ or at all, meaning\nfurther remedial firmware updates are not possible.\
          \  The device is bricked when\nit can't be fixed and is effectively an expensive\
          \ square shaped \"brick\". \n C \n Canonical - Canonical Ltd. is a UK-based\
          \ privately held computer software company founded\n(and funded) by South\
          \ African entrepreneur Mark Shuttleworth to market\ncommercial support and\

          \ Collection Development Storage. \n Ceilometer - The OpenStack Ceilometer\
          \ project aims to deliver a unique point of\ncontact for billing systems\
          \ to acquire all of the measurements they need to\nestablish customer billing,\
          \ across all current OpenStack core components. \n It is also a means by\
          \ which to gather performance related metrics useful for the\ngeneral management\
          \ of the OpenStack environment in general. \n Cell - Cells are a means by\
          \ which to partition an OpenStack compute cloud into groups. \n At NeCTAR\
          \ each site runs a different configuration, as a resource cells in an\n\
          OpenStack Compute cells setup. This allows the NeCTAR nodes to do different\n\
          things such as span multiple data centers, or run off compute node storage\n\
          with a shared file system, or use on compute node storage with a non-shared\
          \ file\nsystem.  It's also a way to partition tenants and accounts. \n CentOS\
          \ - A community-based rebadging of RHEL distribution.  The result is \"\
          for free\", but with\n no support. \n Ceph - \"Ceph is a unified, distributed\
          \ storage system designed for excellent\nperformance, reliability and scalability.\"\
          \  Volume and object storage\nare typically implemented using Ceph. \n CephFS\
          \ - A project aimed and making Ceph work akin to a traditional filesystem\n\
          ala ext4 or xfs.  It is still considered experimental at this stage. \n\
          \ Chef - A recipe based system configuration framework. A main competitor\
          \ to Puppet, but\nalso now to other such systems such as Ansible and Salt.\
          \ \n CIDR Notation - Classless Internet Domain Routing notation - a concise\
          \ notation for writing IPv4\n or IPv6 network address ranges. \n Cinder\
          \ - The OpenStack Volume Storage management service. \n The \"Cloud\" -\
          \ A network of servers used to store, manage, and process data to achieve\n\
          efficiencies of scale in completing various computational tasks. \n CloudStor\
          \ - A free cloud-based file transfer service provided by AARNET. Allows\
          \ researchers\n to send and receive large files (up to 100Gb) or the big\
          \ brother CloudStor+\nwhich is an enhanced version of CloudStor that supports\
          \ secure long-term file\nstorage. \n Cluster-as-a-service - Implementing\
          \ HPC-style compute facilities on top of cloud computing\ninfrastructure.\
          \ \n Collection - RDSI Collection - Large data collection, usually formalised\
          \ with metadata and\nmade discoverable and accessible. Stored as part of\
          \ a data storage investment\nproject called RDSI (Research Data Storage\
          \ Infrastructure). Operators of the\ninfrastructure from RDSI project are\
          \ called RDSI nodes and may still refer to\ntheir storage facilities or\
          \ collections as 'RDSI storage' or 'RDSI collection'. \n Collection VM -\
          \ RDSI collections in QRIScloud are exposed via virtual machines that run\
          \ access\nservices; e.g. scp, sftp, rsync, WebDAV & GridFTP. \n Compute\
          \ Node   - OpenStack terminology for a physical computer\nused to run virtual\
          \ machines. It will typically have multiple CPUs and shared memory, and\n\
          one or more network interfaces.  It may also have on-node disc storage.\
          \ \n Container - General Computing - a means by which to run multiple \"\
          things\" inside a given\ncomputer and have those things isolated from each\
          \ other and the computer itself.\nSimilar in concept to Virtualisation,\
          \ however not as broadly applicable because\nthe containers must be the\
          \ same operating system as the host itself. \n Copyleft - A form of software\
          \ licensing that uses Copyright Law as the legal basis for\ngranting and\
          \ enforcing license terms. \n Creative Commons - A family of licenses originally\
          \ designed for creative (non-software) works,\nthat is often used for published\
          \ scientific data. \n CVL - Characterization Virtual Laboratory - A NeCTAR\
          \ Virtual Laboratory project. \n D \n DaRIS (Distributed and Reflective\
          \ Informatics System) - DaRIS\nis a subject-oriented informatics framework\
          \ and capability developed\nprimarily at the University of Melbourne. It\
          \ is built with the commercial\nMediaflux data operating system. DaRIS is\
          \ mainly used to supply a repository to\nmanage bio-medical imaging data.\
          \ \n Dashboard - The NeCTAR Dashboard is the main web-based interface for\
          \ managing NeCTAR\nvirtuals. The OpenStack component service for the dashboard\
          \ is called Horizon. \n Data Centre - A place where a large collection of\
          \ shared computing equipment is housed.\nThese expensive and high security\
          \ installations are often hot and noisy and\nconsume hard drives for breakfast.\
          \ \n Data Repository - A system or service that provides systematic data\
          \ management services. More\nthan just \"a shared fileserver\". \n .deb\
          \ - The Debian standard package format. See apt. \n Debian Family - Debian,\
          \ Ubuntu, Mint and many lesser known but similar linux distributions. \n\
          \ Distribution (Linux) - Refers to a (ideally) homoginized release of the\
          \ Linux Kernel and a\ncompendium of utilities, services and applications\
          \ that are nominally modified\nand tested to run well together, then given\
          \ an odd name like \"Mandriva\" or\n\"Suse\" or \"Debian\".  May inherit\
          \ concepts, frameworks and software\nfrom other distributions with or without\
          \ attribution or other reciprocal\ncontribution.  Typically distributions\
          \ attract a zealous user base\nwho will willingly fight each other to the\
          \ bitter death over not much at all.\nSome are funded by corporations, others\
          \ by well meaning techno hippies or not\nby anyone at all. \n Distro - A\
          \ contraction of \"Distribution\". \n DMF - DMF is a\nHierarchical Storage\
          \ Management (HSM) system by SGI designed for\nthe bulk storage of data.\
          \ The basic premise is that fast storage is expensive so\nwouldn't it be\
          \ cool if we could put only the data we actually use on the fast\nstorage,\
          \ and the rest can kind of trickle through less expensive storage layers.\n\
          So the hierarchy is in fact a sandwich of storage technologies (usually\
          \ ssd,\nhdd, tape) at each of which the storage cost per gigabyte decreases.\
          \  As data\nages through the layers the usual trade off is speed, so ideally\
          \ frequently used\ndata stays on the faster storage layer.  Conversely,\
          \ data which is seldom\naccessed is often archived off to tape where the\
          \ cost per gigabyte is very low.\nMagical filesystems ideally make all of\
          \ this invisible to users and\napplications.  Usually highly expensive and\
          \ complicated, it's pretty awesome\nwhen it works. \n Docker - A tool that\
          \ helps automate the deployment of applications\ninside software containers.\
          \ \n DropBox - A company that offers cloud storage that is easily used for\
          \ file sharing\nand collaboration. \n Drupal - A popular open source website\
          \ / content management system. \n DSpace - An open source application used\
          \ to create open access repositories\nfor digital content. \n DuraSpace\
          \ - The not-for-profit organization that manages the DSpace and Fedora Repository\n\
          projects. \n E \n EC2 - Amazon's \"Elastic Compute\" offering. \n EC2 Credentials\
          \ - One of the kinds of credentials you can obtain from the NeCTAR Dashboard.\n\
          It allows software written to work with the Amazon cloud to be used with\
          \ the OpenStack cloud. \n Elastic Computing  - Cloud computing resources\
          \ that can be\nadded to or removed from. \n Ephemeral Storage - Disk storage\
          \ associated with a NeCTAR instance that goes away when the\ninstance is\
          \ terminated. \n ERSA - eResearch SA runs the South Australian node of the\
          \ NeCTAR research cloud. \n eSpace - The UQ library managed system for UQ\
          \ research publications. \n eSpaces - A web-based collaboration system for\
          \ the Australian academic community. \n F \n FAQ - A Frequently Asked Question.\
          \ A software project or an IT support organization\nwill often create an\
          \ online FAQ document consisting of a number of such\nquestions, and their\
          \ answers. \n Fedora - RedHat's \"bleeding edge\" Linux distro (It was called\
          \ Fedora Core in early\nreleases). \n Fedora Repository -  The Flexible\
          \ Extensible Digital Object Repository Architecture\nwas developed for storing,\
          \ managing, and accessing digital content in the form of digital\nobjects.\
          \ The Fedora Repository Project (i.e., Fedora) implements the Fedora abstractions\n\
          in a open source software system. \n Fez - A front-end and administration\
          \ tool for the Fedora Repository. \n Flashlight - An RCC / QCIF HPC system\
          \ designed for data intensive computation. \n Flavor - An OpenStack term\
          \ for an instance sizing specification. Gives the amount of\nmemory, number\
          \ of VCPUs and ephemeral disc size. \n G \n Galaxy - A web based platform\
          \ for biomedical research. \n Ganglia - A distributed monitoring system.\
          \ \n Git - A popular distributed version control system. \n Github - A popular\

          \ - <a href=\"https://www.sgi.com/products/storage/idm/dmf.html\">DMF</a>\
          \ is a\nHierarchical Storage Management (HSM) system by SGI designed for\n\
          the bulk storage of data. The basic premise is that fast storage is expensive\
          \ so\nwouldn't it be cool if we could put only the data we actually use\
          \ on the fast\nstorage, and the rest can kind of trickle through less expensive\
          \ storage layers.\nSo the hierarchy is in fact a sandwich of storage technologies\
          \ (usually ssd,\nhdd, tape) at each of which the storage cost per gigabyte\
          \ decreases.  As data\nages through the layers the usual trade off is speed,\
          \ so ideally frequently used\ndata stays on the faster storage layer.  Conversely,\
          \ data which is seldom\naccessed is often archived off to tape where the\
          \ cost per gigabyte is very low.\nMagical filesystems ideally make all of\
          \ this invisible to users and\napplications.  Usually highly expensive and\
          \ complicated, it's pretty awesome\nwhen it works.</p>\n<p><strong>Docker</strong>\

    \ then given an odd name like \"Mandriva\" or\n\"Suse\" or \"Debian\".  May inherit\
    \ concepts, frameworks and software\nfrom other distributions with or without\

    >DMF</a> is a\nHierarchical Storage Management (HSM) system by SGI designed for\n\
    the bulk storage of data. The basic premise is that fast storage is expensive\
    \ so\nwouldn't it be cool if we could put only the data we actually use on the\
    \ fast\nstorage, and the rest can kind of trickle through less expensive storage\
    \ layers.\nSo the hierarchy is in fact a sandwich of storage technologies (usually\
    \ ssd,\nhdd, tape) at each of which the storage cost per gigabyte decreases. \
    \ As data\nages through the layers the usual trade off is speed, so ideally frequently\
    \ used\ndata stays on the faster storage layer.  Conversely, data which is seldom\n\
    accessed is often archived off to tape where the cost per gigabyte is very low.\n\
    Magical filesystems ideally make all of this invisible to users and\napplications.\
    \  Usually highly expensive and complicated, it's pretty awesome\nwhen it works.</p>\n\

  html: '<h2>Installation</h2>

    <p>You can use pip to install the python-swift API and the swfit command line
    API.</p>

    <p>See below for the instructions:</p>

    <p>OS X</p>

    <p>```</p>

    <p>sudo easy_install pip</p>

    <p>sudo pip install --upgrade setuptools</p>

    <p>sudo pip install python-swiftclient</p>

    <p>```</p>

    <p>Ubuntu</p>

    <p>```</p>

    <p>sudo aptitude install python-pip</p>

    <p>sudo pip install python-swiftclient</p>

    <p>```</p>

    <p>RHEL, CentOS, or Fedora</p>

    <p>```</p>

    <p>sudo yum install python-setuptools</p>

    <p>sudo easy_install pip</p>

    <p>sudo pip install --upgrade setuptools</p>

    <p>sudo pip install python-swiftclient</p>

    <p>```</p>

    <p>Windows</p>

    <p>See <a href="http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/win.html#distribute-pip">pip
    windows</a> for instructions on installing pip for Windows.</p>

    <p><code>pip install python-swiftclient</code></p>

    <h2>Configuration</h2>

    <p>Before you can use the python swift client and command line API you need to
    be

    authenticated to the NeCTAR cloud. The below shows the instructions of how to

    get username/password and get authenticated.</p>

    <ol>

    <li>Login to NeCTAR Cloud <a href="https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au">Dashboard</a></li>

    <li>Click ''Access &amp; Security''</li>

    <li>On the ''Access &amp; Security'' page, click tab ''API Access''</li>

    <li>Click button "Download OpenStack RC File"</li>

    <li>Save the file into a directory</li>

    <li>Click the drop down list with your email on the right top of page, then click
    ''Settings''</li>

    <li>Click ''Reset Password'' and save the password appeared on the screen</li>

    </ol>

    <p>API normally requires 4 environment variables to be set for authentication:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>auth URL</li>

    <li>username</li>

    <li>project id or name (most clients can handle either)</li>

    <li>password</li>

    </ul>

    <p>When using the script file you downloaded from NeCTAR Dashboard, these

    varilabels are set by the script file and you can see these variables

    if you open the file. Example:</p>

    <blockquote>

    <p>OS_AUTH_URL: https://keystone.rc.nectar.org.au:5000/v2.0/</p>

    <p>OS_TENANT_NAME=my_science_project</p>

    <p>OS_TENANT_ID=sdfsdfsfwrwewer</p>

    <p>OS_USERNAME=clouduser@example.edu.au</p>

    <p>OS_PASSWORD=XXXXXX</p>

    </blockquote>

    <h2>Authentication for Command Line API</h2>

    <p>The following instruction assume you use Linux operating system.</p>

    <p>Once you have obtained the authentication script and password, you can execute

    the script suing <code>source file-name.sh</code>. and type in the password you

    obtained from Dashboard.</p>

    <h3>Authentication for python swift API</h3>

    <p>You can use the below sample code to get authenticated. </p>

    <p>```</p>

    <p>from swiftclient import client</p>

    <p>swift = client.Connection(authurl=url, user=username, key=password,

    tenant_name=project_name, auth_version=''2'')</p>

    <p>```</p>

    <p>You can get authurl, user, key and tenant_name from the above .sh file obtained

    from the NeCTAR Dashboard.</p>

    <h2>How to use</h2>

    <p>Once the client is authenticated, you can start to use them. See below for
    how

    to get started.</p>

    <h3>Command Line API</h3>

    <p>You can use swift command to manage your objects storage, you can type:</p>

    <p><code>swift --help</code> to find out all the available options.</p>

    <h3>Python Swift API</h3>

    <p>You can also use Python Swift API in your python code to access object storage.</p>

    <p>See below for a sample code:</p>

    <p>```</p>

    <p>from swiftclient import client</p>

    <p>swift = client.Connection(authurl=url, user=username, key=password,

    tenant_name=project_name, auth_version=''2'')</p>

    <p>container_name=""</p>

    <p>swift.get_container(container_name)</p>

    <p>```</p>

    <p>You can find more information in the Object Storage API section. </p>'

    such as the ones at <a href="http://yamllint.com/">YAML Lint</a> or the <a href="http://yaml-online-parser.appspot.com/">Online
    Yaml Parser</a>

    can be useful in finding the syntax error.</p>

    <p>To convert from JSON to YAML, an online converter such as the one at

    <a href="http://jsontoyaml.com/">Convert JSON to YAML Online</a>

    can be useful in porting between the two formats.</p>

    <p>To debug JSON syntax errors the following command set is useful:</p>

    <p><code>cat template.json | python -m json.tool</code></p>

    <p>Where <code>template.json</code> is the name of your template. The command
    simply pipes the

    file into python, which in turn will invoke the json module that finally will

    validate and pretty print the file.</p>

    <p>Similarly, if you have the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyaml/">pyaml</a>
    module installed

    you can validate yaml files:</p>

    <p><code>cat template.yaml | python -m pyaml</code></p>

    <p>Where <code>template.yaml</code> is the name of your template.</p>

    <p>The form of the command in both of the above is useful, in that you can

    verify remote files:</p>

    <p><code>curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NeCTAR-RC/heat-templates/master/json/Fedora/WordPress_2_Instances.json
    | python -m json.tool</code></p>

    <p>If the stack launches, and reports no error, suspicion falls on

    the automated installation of software.</p>

    <p>In this scenario turn to on instances log files and scripts.</p>

    <p>On the newly launched image:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>Heat writes the scripts to the <code>/var/lib/cloud/</code> directory;</li>

    <li>The cloud init log can be found in <code>/var/log/cloud-init.log</code>;</li>

    <li>The output of your code run by cloud init can be found in <code>/var/log/cloud-init-output.log</code>;</li>

    <li>The output of the cfn init output is found in <code>/var/log/cfn-init.log</code>;</li>

    <li>The log showing the parts produced by heat can be found in <code>/var/log/part-handler.log</code>;</li>

    <li>The log showing the output of users scripts run can be found in <code>/var/log/heat-provisioning.log</code>.</li>

    </ul>

    <p>If the stack state does reveal an error start by trying to understand the

    command line client error messages.</p>

    <p>If you have nested templates, you can find the ones that failed to launch with

    the following command:</p>

    <p><code>heat stack-list --show-nested -f "status=FAILED"</code></p>

    <p>For a given template, you can see the list of events associated with the

    template:</p>

    <p><code>heat event-list &lt;template id&gt;</code></p>

    <p>You can then drill down into the events for a given resource:</p>

    <p><code>heat event-list -r &lt;resource name&gt; &lt;template id&gt;</code></p>

    <p>And then examine a specific event for more detail:</p>

    <p><code>heat event-show &lt;template id&gt; &lt;resource name&gt; &lt;event id&gt;</code></p>'

          \ of the fundamentals of Operating\nSystem on your Virtual Machines to implement\
          \ a good security policy. \n What is security?  Security is a set of appropriate\
          \ procedures to protect your\nresources (your data, your account, your services\
          \ and your reputation) against\nrisks. \n The NeCTAR cloud is a public Cloud\
          \ environment. Thus your virtual machines are\nconnected to the rest of\
          \ the world and there are many potential risks associated\nwith that. You\
          \ should always consider your Virtual Machines are vulnerable and\nsome\
          \ security policy and procedures must be implemented. \n Security is a big\
          \ topic and there many complete books on the subject. This\nguide provides\
          \ some basic introduction to security and how the techniques, and\ntools\
          \ can be used to provide additional security on a Virtual Machine. \n Security\
          \ requirements \n Before you implement security policy, you should consider\
          \ the aspects of\nsecurity that are required. The main security requirements\
          \ are:  \n \n \n Confidentiality (don't let anybody else know your password\
          \ confidential data) \n \n \n Authorization (Only allow these that need\
          \ to access data) \n \n \n Integrity (Ensure that the data has not been\
          \ modified) \n \n \n Availability (Ensure that system can perform its required\
          \ functions) \n \n \n Type of Attackers \n It is important to know the type\
          \ of attackers to the Virtual Machine. The types\nof attackers are listed\
          \ below: \n \n \n Crackers, there are people that gain unauthorized access\
          \ to a computer \n \n \n Hackers, any individual who illegally breaks into\
          \ computer systems to damage, \n steal information or perform some malicious\
          \ functions using the systems. \n \n \n Types of attacks against virtual\
          \ machines \n There are many different types of attacks and are different\
          \ depending upon the\noperating system, the service and type of attackers.\
          \ The below list only\nprovides some common types of attack and aims to\
          \ provide an idea of what areas to\nfocus on. \n \n \n Reading data: typically\
          \ associated with steal important information such as\n confidential data,\
          \ account information, passwords, etc. \n \n \n Changing data: potentially\
          \ to gain sufficient access to be able to update data \n \n \n Access to\
          \ virtual machine: get access to your virtual machine and use it to\n attach\
          \ other computer systems. The attackers might setup a service to send email\n\
          \ spam using your virtual machines \n \n \n Denial of service: attacker\
          \ disables or makes unusable the services provided\n by the system  \n \n\
          \ \n Common Methods of Attacking A Virtual machine \n The below shows some\
          \ techniques used to gain access and it only provides an idea\nof methods\
          \ used and doesn't include all available methods. \n \n \n Password guessing:\
          \ where attacks try to guess your system account password and\n in the hope\
          \ they will be lucky and find an easily guessed password. \n \n \n Social\
          \ engineering: attackers pretend to be someone you trust and gain\n information\
          \ (e.g. password) from you. \n \n \n Trojan horses: these are programs planted\
          \ in a virtual machine which appear to be\n harmless. When a trigger is\
          \ activated, the attacker can gain access to the \n virtual machine and\
          \ run certain commands. There are various ways these programs\n get onto\
          \ your virtual machines, such as by installing untrusted software\n packages.\
          \ \n \n \n virus: a virus is a program designed to damage the system. \n\
          \ \n \n software bugs: a software bug can lead to a security exposure. \n\
          \ \n \n address spoofing: this is to change the IP address of the computer,\
          \ to pretend \n it is a trusted system and gain access.  \n \n \n Security\
          \ Policy \n If you already have a security policy in place, you need to\
          \ follow these steps\nto secure your virtual machines. If you don't have\
          \ one, there are a number of\nfactors you need to consider when you are\
          \ creating a security policy. \n You need to make sure you have covered\
          \ each of the issues: Authorization, Authentication,\nConfidentiality, Integrity\
          \ and Availability. You also need to consider how the\npolicy is going to\
          \ be implemented as people might make mistakes. You should\nalways consider\
          \ how this can be enforced and audited.  "

    \ at all stages of setting up your\nVirtual Machines. It requires good knowledge\
    \ of the fundamentals of Operating\nSystem on your Virtual Machines to implement\
    \ a good security policy.</p>\n<p>What is security?  Security is a set of appropriate\
    \ procedures to protect your\nresources (your data, your account, your services\
    \ and your reputation) against\nrisks.</p>\n<p>The NeCTAR cloud is a public Cloud\
    \ environment. Thus your virtual machines are\nconnected to the rest of the world\
    \ and there are many potential risks associated\nwith that. You should always\
    \ consider your Virtual Machines are vulnerable and\nsome security policy and\
    \ procedures must be implemented.</p>\n<p>Security is a big topic and there many\
    \ complete books on the subject. This\nguide provides some basic introduction\
    \ to security and how the techniques, and\ntools can be used to provide additional\
    \ security on a Virtual Machine.</p>\n<h2>Security requirements</h2>\n<p>Before\
    \ you implement security policy, you should consider the aspects of\nsecurity\
    \ that are required. The main security requirements are: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Confidentiality\
    \ (don't let anybody else know your password confidential data)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\
    <p>Authorization (Only allow these that need to access data)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\
    <p>Integrity (Ensure that the data has not been modified)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Availability\
    \ (Ensure that system can perform its required functions)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\
    <h2>Type of Attackers</h2>\n<p>It is important to know the type of attackers to\
    \ the Virtual Machine. The types\nof attackers are listed below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n\
    <p>Crackers, there are people that gain unauthorized access to a computer</p>\n\

          \ impossible to address everything. This\ndocument lists a number of security\
          \ recommendations to help ensure the safe\nrunning of your instances on\
          \ the cloud. Security is important, so please\nfollow these. \n The NecTAR\
          \ team conduct routine and random audits to determine the integrity\nof\
          \ machine images and running instances. If you have discovered a critical\n\
          security flaw, or believe your machine has been compromised, please email\n\
          security@rc.nectar.org.au; or for non-urgent security questions go to NeCTAR\n\
          support to lodge a ticket. \n Mail Servers \n If you run a mail server,\
          \ make sure it only listens on the localhost IP\naddress (127.0.0.1). For\
          \ many clients, if you don't specify an SMTP server\nwhen sending email,\
          \ it will use the recipients SMTP server automatically. This\nis probably\
          \ what you want. Some nodes (Qld) disallow this and require you to\nuse\
          \ their SMTP server for outgoing mail. \n Enable Automatic Updates \n All\
          \ operating systems have the ability to apply updates automatically, and\
          \ its\neasy to turn this on. Please do so, and ask us if you need help.\
          \ \n Upgrade your kernel \n Some updates, such as a kernel upgrade, require\
          \ a reboot of the instance. Please\nschedule this into your regular maintenance.\
          \ \n No open recursive name servers \n If you are running a DNS server,\
          \ please ensure you only allow recursion from\ntrusted hosts. \n Control\
          \ or disable access to your NTP server \n If you run an NTP server, limit\
          \ which systems can access it. Disable the\n'monlist' command as this can\
          \ be used as a denial of service vector on your\nsystem. For info about\
          \ DDoS by NTP, see\nthis article on Cloudflare \n Subscribe to security\
          \ announcements for your OS \n If there is a security problem with your\
          \ Operating System, you need to find\nout as soon as possible. Find the\
          \ appropriate mailing list and keep an eye\nout for anything that requires\
          \ urgent action. As soon as new security bugs are\ndetected, you need to\
          \ execute security upgrade immediately.  \n Run a restrictive firewall \n\
          \ Your instances should be configured so they allow the minimum access required\n\
          to run their service. Please use a host-based firewall, in conjunction with\n\
          the cloud-provided firewall to manage access. \n Disable/Remove unneeded\
          \ accounts \n Keep an eye on the user accounts enabled on your system. Some\
          \ applications\ncreate default accounts which are insecure. You may also\
          \ open a temporary user\naccount to allow quick login for a task and leave\
          \ it forever. This may lead to\nsecurity issue later, and you need to regular\
          \ check and delete these user\naccounts. \n Disable SSH password login -\
          \ use keys \n With enough time and compute power it is possible for passwords\
          \ to be brute\nforce attacked. The average SSH server deals with thousands\
          \ of such attacks\nevery week, so use ssh keys. Ubuntu provides some good\
          \ documentation for it. \n Don't store keys on the image \n The cloud provides\
          \ a metadata service so you can download keys on boot, so\nyou don't need\
          \ to copy keys manually. This ensures that if your key is\ncompromised,\
          \ not all running instances of that image are compromised. \n Install SSH\
          \ attack banning tools \n Install a tools like fail2ban or denyhosts, which\
          \ checks log files for\nattempted breaches and then blocks malicious IP\
          \ addresses. \n Disable unneeded services \n Know what services run on your\
          \ image, and disable the unneeded ones before\nyou upload it. This reduces\
          \ the attack surface. \n Use Encrypted Communications \n Wherever possible,\
          \ use encrypted communications to avoid attacks which\nintercept data. \n\
          \ Use best-practices for logging \n Make sure that services are logging\
          \ to a secure location, that is as\ntamperproof as possible. If logging\
          \ remotely, ensure that it is done over\na secure channel so that eavesdroppers\
          \ cannot monitor what is happening on\nyour instance. \n Only open ports\
          \ for required services \n By default, virtual machines in NeCTAR has closed\
          \ all ports, so in order to make\nservices available to public, you need\
          \ to open certain ports for it. Before you\nopen a open, you need to think\
          \ carefully about what service associated with it\nand what is the intention.\
          \ Never open ports for non-service binded to it. \n Only grant sufficient\
          \ permission to user account \n When creating user account, make sure only\
          \ permission sufficient for its use \nis granted. Never grant extra permission\
          \ if it is not needed. \n Disable root access from SSH and use sudo if possible\
          \ \n Disable root user SSH login and setup user account with sudo permission\
          \ to\nperform administrator tasks. \n Use other port for SSH \n The SSH\
          \ service on the virtual machine uses port 22 by default. This port is \n\
          well-known and can attract many attackers. Use a custom ssh port other than\
          \ 22\nwill improve security. Be noted, the port number below 1024 is well\
          \ reserved and\nshouldn't be used for SSH. \n Read security guide for service\
          \ installed \n Before and after you install a new service on your virtual\
          \ machine, you need to\ncheck the service security guide to perform any\
          \ required steps to harden the\nservice security. "

  html: "<h2>Getting Started</h2>\n<p>Security is an complex topic and it is impossible\
    \ to address everything. This\ndocument lists a number of security recommendations\
    \ to help ensure the safe\nrunning of your instances on the cloud. Security is\
    \ important, so please\nfollow these.</p>\n<p>The NecTAR team conduct routine\
    \ and random audits to determine the integrity\nof machine images and running\
    \ instances. If you have discovered a critical\nsecurity flaw, or believe your\
    \ machine has been compromised, please email\n<a href=\"&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#115;&#101;&#99;&#117;&#114;&#105;&#116;&#121;&#64;&#114;&#99;&#46;&#110;&#101;&#99;&#116;&#97;&#114;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#103;&#46;&#97;&#117;\"\
    >&#115;&#101;&#99;&#117;&#114;&#105;&#116;&#121;&#64;&#114;&#99;&#46;&#110;&#101;&#99;&#116;&#97;&#114;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#103;&#46;&#97;&#117;</a>;\
    \ or for non-urgent security questions go to NeCTAR\n<a href=\"https://support.nectar.org.au/support/home\"\
    >support</a> to lodge a ticket.</p>\n<h2>Mail Servers</h2>\n<p>If you run a mail\
    \ server, make sure it only listens on the localhost IP\naddress (127.0.0.1).\
    \ For many clients, if you don't specify an SMTP server\nwhen sending email, it\
    \ will use the recipients SMTP server automatically. This\nis probably what you\
    \ want. Some nodes (Qld) disallow this and require you to\nuse their SMTP server\
    \ for outgoing mail.</p>\n<h2>Enable Automatic Updates</h2>\n<p>All operating\
    \ systems have the ability to apply updates automatically, and its\neasy to turn\
    \ this on. Please do so, and ask us if you need help.</p>\n<h2>Upgrade your kernel</h2>\n\
    <p>Some updates, such as a kernel upgrade, require a reboot of the instance. Please\n\
    schedule this into your regular maintenance.</p>\n<h2>No open recursive name servers</h2>\n\
    <p>If you are running a DNS server, please ensure you only allow recursion from\n\
    trusted hosts.</p>\n<h2>Control or disable access to your NTP server</h2>\n<p>If\
    \ you run an NTP server, limit which systems can access it. Disable the\n'monlist'\
    \ command as this can be used as a denial of service vector on your\nsystem. For\
    \ info about DDoS by NTP, see\n<a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/understanding-and-mitigating-ntp-based-ddos-attacks/\"\
    \ title=\"Cloudflare Understanding NTP DDoS\">this article on Cloudflare</a></p>\n\
    <h2>Subscribe to security announcements for your OS</h2>\n<p>If there is a security\
    \ problem with your Operating System, you need to find\nout as soon as possible.\
    \ Find the appropriate mailing list and keep an eye\nout for anything that requires\
    \ urgent action. As soon as new security bugs are\ndetected, you need to execute\
    \ security upgrade immediately. </p>\n<h2>Run a restrictive firewall</h2>\n<p>Your\
    \ instances should be configured so they allow the minimum access required\nto\
    \ run their service. Please use a host-based firewall, in conjunction with\nthe\
    \ cloud-provided firewall to manage access.</p>\n<h2>Disable/Remove unneeded accounts</h2>\n\
    <p>Keep an eye on the user accounts enabled on your system. Some applications\n\
    create default accounts which are insecure. You may also open a temporary user\n\
    account to allow quick login for a task and leave it forever. This may lead to\n\
    security issue later, and you need to regular check and delete these user\naccounts.</p>\n\
    <h2>Disable SSH password login - use keys</h2>\n<p>With enough time and compute\
    \ power it is possible for passwords to be brute\nforce attacked. The average\
    \ SSH server deals with thousands of such attacks\nevery week, so use ssh keys.\
    \ Ubuntu provides some good documentation for it.</p>\n<h2>Don't store keys on\
    \ the image</h2>\n<p>The cloud provides a metadata service so you can download\
    \ keys on boot, so\nyou don't need to copy keys manually. This ensures that if\
    \ your key is\ncompromised, not all running instances of that image are compromised.</p>\n\
    <h2>Install SSH attack banning tools</h2>\n<p>Install a tools like fail2ban or\
    \ denyhosts, which checks log files for\nattempted breaches and then blocks malicious\
    \ IP addresses.</p>\n<h2>Disable unneeded services</h2>\n<p>Know what services\
    \ run on your image, and disable the unneeded ones before\nyou upload it. This\
    \ reduces the attack surface.</p>\n<h2>Use Encrypted Communications</h2>\n<p>Wherever\
    \ possible, use encrypted communications to avoid attacks which\nintercept data.</p>\n\
    <h2>Use best-practices for logging</h2>\n<p>Make sure that services are logging\
    \ to a secure location, that is as\ntamperproof as possible. If logging remotely,\
    \ ensure that it is done over\na secure channel so that eavesdroppers cannot monitor\
    \ what is happening on\nyour instance.</p>\n<h2>Only open ports for required services</h2>\n\
    <p>By default, virtual machines in NeCTAR has closed all ports, so in order to\
    \ make\nservices available to public, you need to open certain ports for it. Before\
    \ you\nopen a open, you need to think carefully about what service associated\
    \ with it\nand what is the intention. Never open ports for non-service binded\
    \ to it.</p>\n<h2>Only grant sufficient permission to user account</h2>\n<p>When\
    \ creating user account, make sure only permission sufficient for its use \nis\
    \ granted. Never grant extra permission if it is not needed.</p>\n<h2>Disable\
    \ root access from SSH and use sudo if possible</h2>\n<p>Disable root user SSH\
    \ login and setup user account with sudo permission to\nperform administrator\
    \ tasks.</p>\n<h2>Use other port for SSH</h2>\n<p>The SSH service on the virtual\
    \ machine uses port 22 by default. This port is \nwell-known and can attract many\
    \ attackers. Use a custom ssh port other than 22\nwill improve security. Be noted,\
    \ the port number below 1024 is well reserved and\nshouldn't be used for SSH.</p>\n\
    <h2>Read security guide for service installed</h2>\n<p>Before and after you install\
    \ a new service on your virtual machine, you need to\ncheck the service security\
    \ guide to perform any required steps to harden the\nservice security.</p>"

  html: '<h1>The Heat command line client</h1>

    <p>In true OpenStack fashion there is a <a href="http://docs.openstack.org/user-guide/cli.html">Heat
    command line client</a>.

    To our biased eye, the command line tool seems more fully featured and

    gives more detailed feedback than the dashboard, so we prefer to use it

    when developing templates.</p>

    <p>Instructions on installing the command line tools can be found

    <a href="http://docs.openstack.org/user-guide/common/cli_install_openstack_command_line_clients.html">here</a>.</p>

    <p>We will step through some the actions the command line tool can perform,

    using one of the NeCTAR Heat sample templates.</p>

    <p>To list all the stacks you have created do (don''t forget to source your

    RC file before you start!):</p>

    <p><code>heat stack-list</code></p>

    <p>Repeat the above command liberally as you step through the following commands!</p>

    <p>To validate the template (all one line):</p>

    <p><code>heat template-validate --template-url https://raw.github.com/NeCTAR-RC/heat-templates/master/yaml/Fedora/WordPress_Single_Instance.yaml</code></p>

    <p>Then to use the template to create a stack named "teststack" (again, all one
    line):</p>

    <p><code>heat create teststack --template-url=https://raw.github.com/NeCTAR-RC/heat-templates/master/yaml/Fedora/WordPress_Single_Instance.yaml
    --parameters="InstanceType=m1.small;DBUsername=dbuser;DBPassword=verybadpassword;DBRootPassword=anotherverybadpassword;KeyName=nectar_dev"</code></p>

    <p><em>PS</em>: Don''t forget to customise the command: e.g.: replace the passwords
    with far

    better ones, and also to change the key name to match one of your keys.</p>

          \ You can manage instances for users via\nNeCTAR Dashboard. You can perform\
          \ many tasks such as view,\nterminate, reboot and create a snapshot from\
          \ an instance, etc.  \n Control the state of an instance \n To manage and\
          \ change the state of an instance, you can login to the NeCTAR\nDashboard\
          \ and follow the below steps: \n \n \n Login to Dashboard \n \n \n Authenticate\
          \ yourself via AAF \n \n \n Click 'Instances' on the left side of the page\
          \ and click 'Action' drop down\n list for an instance. You should see something\
          \ similar as the below screenshot \n \n \n \n The drop down list includes\
          \ all the available actions you can use to manage the\ninstance. The below\
          \ gives a brief explanation about them: \n \n \n Create Snapshot: create\
          \ a snapshot of instance. The snapshot will save all the\n state of instance\
          \ at the time you taking the snapshot and it can be used an\n image to launch\
          \ a new instance with all the saved state. Only primary disk is\n saved.\
          \ \n \n \n Edit Instance: change the name of the instance. \n \n \n Edit\
          \ Security Groups: you can add/delete security groups associated with the\n\
          \ instance. This allows your open/close ports after instance has been launched.\
          \ \n \n \n Console: this action allows you to access the instance via the\
          \ VNC console and\n allow your to access the instance via the web browser.\
          \ \n \n \n View Log: this action allows you view the boot messages that\
          \ normally displayed\n on the standard output (monitor). This is useful\
          \ for debugging. \n \n \n Pause Instance: this action temporarily pauses\
          \ the state of a running instance,\n it is useful for taking a snapshot.\
          \ \n \n \n Suspend Instance: this action stops a running instance. The difference\
          \ between\n pause and suspend is that pause is only for a shot period, all\
          \ resources binded\n to an instance are still available and suspend is for\
          \ long-term and resources may\n be removed. \n \n \n Soft Reboot Instance:\
          \ this action allows users to reboot the running instance. \n \n \n Hard\
          \ Reboot Instance: this action allows users to reboot the running instance.\n\
          \ The difference between soft reboot and hard reboot are that soft reboot\
          \ issues\n reboot signal to the running instance and will do a smooth reboot\
          \ and the hard\n reboot simulates the reboot like pressing the computer\
          \ power button. It is useful\n if the running instance is not responding\
          \ to any commands. \n \n \n Rebuild Instance: use different image to build\
          \ a new instance. The new instance\n maintains the same specification of\
          \ the old instance such as cpus, rams and etc.\n Remember, this action will\
          \ destroy all data in the instance and need to use with\n caution. \n \n\
          \ \n Terminate Instance: permanently delete the instance and data is removed\
          \ as well. \n \n \n You can refer to this document to see more information\
          \ about\nmanaging instances. \n Create instance snapshots \n To create an\
          \ snapshot, you can click 'Create Snapshot' from the above action list\n\
          and you will see a pop-up window like below: \n \n Provide a meaningful\
          \ name and the click 'Create Snapshot' button. \n Notes: You should always\
          \ pause the instance before snapshot it. However, live\nsnapshot is also\
          \ possible and you need to make sure the snapshot is consistent\nwith the\
          \ instance as the snapshot doesn't capture the state of the memory. So\n\
          before snapshot, you need to ensure that: \n \n \n running programs have\
          \ written their contenst to disk \n \n \n the file system does not have\
          \ any 'dirty' buffers \n \n \n For Linux user, you can execute sync to write\
          \ dirty buffer to disk.\nIt is not sufficient to only use sync to get file\
          \ system consistent. It is\nrecommend to use fsfreeze tool. In ubuntu, you\
          \ can run sudo apt-get install util-linux\nto install the fsfreeze tool.\
          \ \n To freeze a file system, you can run fsfreeze -f /mnt as a root user\n\
          in a command line console, where /mnt is the file system mount point. \n\
          \ After you created the snapshot, you can unfreeze the file system by executing\
          \ fsfreeze -u /mnt\nwhere /mnt is the file system mount point. \n You can\
          \ refer to Taking Snapshot for more information. \n Change security group\
          \ \n You can click \"Edit Security groups\" from the drop down list to add/remove\n\
          security group for a running instance. \n \n From the above screenshot,\
          \ You can see the currently applied security groups are\nlisted on the right\
          \ hand side and left hand side is a list of available security\ngroups.\
          \ You can click the plus button to add the available security groups\nto\
          \ the right hand side and click the minus button to remove a security group.\n\
          Once you have done, you can click 'Save' button to save your changes.  \n\
          \ Launch a VNC console \n Sometimes, you need to access your instance directly\
          \ via a web browser and you\ncan do it by using the VNC console. The console\
          \ provides a great way to access\nthe instance if you haven't open port\
          \ for SSH. \n Click the \"console\" item from the drop down list and you\
          \ should see a screen\nlike below: \n \n You can then click the 'Click here\
          \ to show only console' and you should see the\nfollowing screen: \n \n\
          \ After the login prompt appears, you can type in username and password\
          \ to login\nto the instance and perform any task as required. \n View log\
          \ \n The console log provides very useful information that may be required\
          \ in\ntroubleshooting issues. You can access the log by clicking \"view\
          \ log\" item from\nthe action drop down list. After clicking, you should\
          \ see the following screen: \n \n This gives you the latest system log messages,\
          \ if you want to see the full logs,\nyou can click the 'View Full Log Button'.\
          \ \n Create and Manage Volumes \n You can attach volumes as persistent storage\
          \ to instances. You can attach or\ndetach a volume from a instance at any\
          \ time and it is also easy to create snapshot\nfrom or delete a volume.\
          \ \n To create a volume, you can follow the below steps: \n \n \n Log in\
          \ to the dashboard \n \n \n select the project from the CURRENT PROJECT\
          \ on the Project tab \n \n \n On the Project tab, open the Compute tab and\
          \ click Volumes category \n \n \n Click 'Create Volume' button \n \n \n\
          \ In the pop-up window, you can enter or select the following values: \n\
          \ \n \n Volume Name: name for the volume \n Description: description for\
          \ the volume \n Type: Leave this field blank \n Size: The size of the volume\
          \ in gigabytes \n Volume Source: To create a standard empty disk for data\
          \ storage, select \"No source, empty volume\" \n Availability Zone: Select\
          \ the Availability Zone from the list \n \n \n Click 'Create Volume' button\
          \ \n \n \n The dashboard shows the volume on the 'Volumes' tab. \n \n \n\
          \ To attach a volume to an instance:  \n \n \n Log in to the dashboard[dashboard\
          \ ] \n \n \n select the project from the CURRENT PROJECT on the Project\
          \ tab \n \n \n On the Project tab, open the Compute tab and click Volumes\
          \ category \n \n \n Select the volume to add to an instance and in the action\
          \ drop down list, \n click Edit Attachments \n \n \n In the Manage Volume\
          \ Attachments dialog box, select an instance and click\n 'Attach Volume'\
          \ button \n \n \n To detach a volume from an instance: \n \n \n Log in to\
          \ the dashboard, choose a project, and click Volumes \n \n \n Select the\
          \ volume and click Edit Attachments \n \n \n Click 'Detach Volume' button\
          \ and confirm your changes \n \n \n To delete a volume: \n \n \n Log in\
          \ to the dashboard, choose a project, and click Volumes \n \n \n Select\
          \ the check boxes for the volumes that you want to delete. \n \n \n Click\
          \ 'Delete Volumes' button and confirm your choice. \n \n \n Note: the data\
          \ in its attached volumes is not destroyed after you delete a volume "

          \ instance snapshots</h2>\n<p>To create an snapshot, you can click 'Create\
          \ Snapshot' from the above action list\nand you will see a pop-up window\
          \ like below:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"snapshot\" src=\"https://github.com/NeCTAR-RC/nectarcloud-tier0doco/blob/master/articles/Cloud%20Expert--DOCID19/Instance%20Management--DOCID39/images/snapshot.png?raw=true\"\
          ></p>\n<p>Provide a meaningful name and the click 'Create Snapshot' button.</p>\n\
          <p>Notes: You should always pause the instance before snapshot it. However,\
          \ live\nsnapshot is also possible and you need to make sure the snapshot\
          \ is consistent\nwith the instance as the snapshot doesn't capture the state\
          \ of the memory. So\nbefore snapshot, you need to ensure that:</p>\n<ul>\n\
          <li>\n<p>running programs have written their contenst to disk</p>\n</li>\n\
          <li>\n<p>the file system does not have any 'dirty' buffers</p>\n</li>\n\
          </ul>\n<p>For Linux user, you can execute <code>sync</code> to write dirty\
          \ buffer to disk.\nIt is not sufficient to only use sync to get file system\
          \ consistent. It is\nrecommend to use fsfreeze tool. In ubuntu, you can\
          \ run <code>sudo apt-get install util-linux</code>\nto install the fsfreeze\
          \ tool.</p>\n<p>To freeze a file system, you can run <code>fsfreeze -f /mnt</code>\
          \ as a root user\nin a command line console, where /mnt is the file system\
          \ mount point.</p>\n<p>After you created the snapshot, you can unfreeze\
          \ the file system by executing <code>fsfreeze -u /mnt</code>\nwhere /mnt\
          \ is the file system mount point.</p>\n<p>You can refer to <a href=\"http://docs.openstack.org/openstack-ops/content/snapshots.html\"\

    \ can manage instances for users via\nNeCTAR <a href=\"https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au/\"\
    >Dashboard</a>. You can perform many tasks such as view,\nterminate, reboot and\
    \ create a snapshot from an instance, etc. </p>\n<h2>Control the state of an instance</h2>\n\
    <p>To manage and change the state of an instance, you can login to the NeCTAR\n\
    <a href=\"https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au/\">Dashboard</a> and follow the below\
    \ steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Login to <a href=\"https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au/\"\
    >Dashboard</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Authenticate yourself via AAF</p>\n</li>\n\
    <li>\n<p>Click 'Instances' on the left side of the page and click 'Action' drop\
    \ down\n list for an instance. You should see something similar as the below screenshot</p>\n\
    </li>\n</ul>\n<p><img alt=\"instance management\" src=\"https://github.com/NeCTAR-RC/nectarcloud-tier0doco/blob/master/articles/Cloud\
    \ Expert--DOCID19/Instance Management--DOCID39/images/instance_management.png?raw=true\"\
    ></p>\n<p>The drop down list includes all the available actions you can use to\
    \ manage the\ninstance. The below gives a brief explanation about them:</p>\n\
    <ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Create Snapshot:</strong> create a snapshot of instance.\
    \ The snapshot will save all the\n state of instance at the time you taking the\
    \ snapshot and it can be used an\n image to launch a new instance with all the\
    \ saved state. Only primary disk is\n saved.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Edit\
    \ Instance:</strong> change the name of the instance.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Edit\
    \ Security Groups:</strong> you can add/delete security groups associated with\
    \ the\n instance. This allows your open/close ports after instance has been launched.</p>\n\
    </li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Console:</strong> this action allows you to access the\
    \ instance via the VNC console and\n allow your to access the instance via the\
    \ web browser.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>View Log:</strong> this action allows\
    \ you view the boot messages that normally displayed\n on the standard output\
    \ (monitor). This is useful for debugging.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Pause\
    \ Instance:</strong> this action temporarily pauses the state of a running instance,\n\
    \ it is useful for taking a snapshot.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Suspend Instance:</strong>\
    \ this action stops a running instance. The difference between\n pause and suspend\
    \ is that pause is only for a shot period, all resources binded\n to an instance\
    \ are still available and suspend is for long-term and resources may\n be removed.</p>\n\
    </li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Soft Reboot Instance:</strong> this action allows users\
    \ to reboot the running instance.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Hard Reboot Instance:</strong>\
    \ this action allows users to reboot the running instance.\n The difference between\
    \ soft reboot and hard reboot are that soft reboot issues\n reboot signal to the\
    \ running instance and will do a smooth reboot and the hard\n reboot simulates\
    \ the reboot like pressing the computer power button. It is useful\n if the running\
    \ instance is not responding to any commands.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Rebuild\
    \ Instance:</strong> use different image to build a new instance. The new instance\n\
    \ maintains the same specification of the old instance such as cpus, rams and\
    \ etc.\n Remember, this action will destroy all data in the instance and need\
    \ to use with\n caution.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Terminate Instance:</strong>\
    \ permanently delete the instance and data is removed as well.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\

          \ to manage your instances in projects and NeCTAR\ncloud provides instance\
          \ management via API. There are two types of API you can use\nto manage\
          \ your instance, one is Nova command line API and another is Nova python\n\
          API. Which one to use depends on your needs. The Nova python API is great\
          \ if you\nwant integrate it with python programming to manage instance in\
          \ a programmatic way.\nIf you are a system administrator and you probably\
          \ will prefer to use Nova command\nline API through a console to manage\
          \ instances. Both of them provides more\nmanagement options than you can\
          \ do through the Dashboard.  \n Installation \n You can use pip to install\
          \ the python-nova API and the nova command line API. \n See below for the\

          \ \n Configuration \n Before you can use the python nova client and command\
          \ line API you need to be\nauthenticated to the NeCTAR cloud. The below\
          \ shows the instructions of how to\nget username/password and get authenticated.\
          \ \n \n \n Login to NeCTAR Cloud Dashboard \n \n \n Click the drop down\
          \ list beside the top left nectar logo to select a project \n \n \n Click\
          \ 'Access & Security' \n \n \n On the 'Access & Security' page, click tab\
          \ 'API Access' \n \n \n Click button \"Download OpenStack RC File\" \n \n\
          \ \n Save the file into a directory \n \n \n Click the drop down list with\

          \ 'Reset Password' and save the password appeared on the screen \n \n \n\
          \ Nova API normally requires 4 environment variables to be set for authentication:\
          \ \n \n auth URL \n username \n project id or name (most clients can handle\
          \ either) \n password \n \n When using the script file you downloaded from\
          \ NeCTAR Dashboard, these\nvariables are set by the script file and you\
          \ can see these variables\nif you open the file. Example: \n \n OS_AUTH_URL:\
          \ https://keystone.rc.nectar.org.au:5000/v2.0/ \nOS_TENANT_NAME=my_science_project\
          \ \nOS_TENANT_ID=sdfsdfsfwrwewer \nOS_USERNAME=clouduser@example.edu.au\
          \ \nOS_PASSWORD=XXXXXX \n \n Authentication for Command Line API \n The\
          \ below instruction assumes you use Linux operating system. \n Once you\
          \ have obtained the authentication script and password, you can execute\n\
          the script using source file-name.sh. and type in the password you\nobtained\
          \ from Dashboard. \n Authentication for python swift API \n You can use\
          \ the below sample code to get authenticated.  \n from novaclient import\
          \ client \n nova = client.Client(VERSION, USERNAME, PASSWORD, PROJECT_NAME,\
          \ AUTH_URL) \n The VERSION parameter can be \"1.1\" or \"2\". You can get\
          \ USERNAME, PROJECT_NAME and\nAUTH_URL from the above .sh file obtained\
          \ from the NeCTAR Dashboard and you can\nalso get the PASSWORD from above\

          \ is a security policy applied and\nyour account might not have sufficient\
          \ permission.  \n Managing an Instance \n To boot a new instance, you need\
          \ to get image name, keypair name, security group\nname and flavor name.\
          \ You can use the above mentioned commands to acquire these\ninformation.\
          \ Then, you can use nova boot command to launch a new instance, the\nformat\
          \ is: \n nova boot [instance-name]  --flavor [name] --image [name] --key-name\
          \ [name] --security-groups [names separated by space] \n You can also specify\
          \ option --availability-zone to launch an instance in a\ndesigned zone and\
          \ option --user-data  for a initialization script\nused only for the first\
          \ time when instance boots. The user data script can be\nput in a file and\
          \ then passed to instance creation. You can see check this\nwebsite to see\

          \ you can always read the error message and generally it give\nyou very\

          \ takes more effects as it depends on how familiar\nwith Python programming\
          \ and what development environment you use. \n The below provides some basic\
          \ information about how you debug the Nova Python\nAPI. \n You can debug\
          \ your python code using Python debugger called pdb and you can find\nmore\
          \ information here. \n The below code uses pdb debuuger to debug a python\
          \ file contains clinet python\nAPI code. \n pdb file_name.py \n Once you\
          \ executed the above code, the command line will be stopped on the first\n\
          line of code and you can use some commands to control the execution flow.\
          \ \n Some useful ones to use are: \n\n\n\nCommand\nAction\n\n\n\n\nb\nset\
          \ a breakpoint\n\n\nc\ncontinue debugging until you hit a breakpoint\n\n\

          \nd\nnavigate down a stack frame\n\n\np\nto print the value of an expression\
          \ in the current context\n\n\n\n Debugging Via HTTP \n The both of command\
          \ line API and python API are restful web service client.\nThus the requests\
          \ are all made by using HTTP and you can always refer to\nOpenStack Service\
          \ End for further references about what should be\npresented in the HTTP\
          \ requests. The Nova API uses requests library\nto send and receive HTTP\
          \ requests/responses. \n For command line client, you can add --debug option\
          \ to print out HTTP request\nheader and HTTP response header, which give\
          \ you a lot of more insight\ninformation. To verify parameters in the request\
          \ header, you can refer to\nOpenStack service API to see what are expected.\
          \ \n To enable debugging information on the standard out for Python API,\
          \ you can add\nthe below code: \n ``` \n import logging \n logger = logging.getLogger(\"\
          novaclient\") \n logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG) \n ``` \n The\
          \ will print the same output as adding --debug option for command line API.\
          \ \n Debugging via Source Code \n If the above techniques are still not\
          \ helpful, you can always look at the source\ncode to find the problems.\
          \ \n The below source file structure is based on the installation in Ubuntu.\
          \ \n The command line nova command is located in '/usr/bin/nova'. By looking\

    <h2>Debugging Via HTTP</h2>

    <p>The both of command line API and python API are restful web service client.

    Thus the requests are all made by using HTTP and you can always refer to

    <a href="http://developer.openstack.org/api-ref-objectstorage-v1.html">OpenStack
    Service End</a> for further references about what should be

    presented in the HTTP requests. The Nova API uses <a href="http://www.python-requests.org/en/latest/">requests</a>
    library

    to send and receive HTTP requests/responses.</p>

    <p>For command line client, you can add --debug option to print out HTTP request

    header and HTTP response header, which give you a lot of more insight

    information. To verify parameters in the request header, you can refer to

    OpenStack service <a href="http://developer.openstack.org/api-ref-objectstorage-v1.html">API</a>
    to see what are expected.</p>

    <p>To enable debugging information on the standard out for Python API, you can
    add

    the below code:</p>

    <p>```</p>

    <p>import logging</p>

    <p>logger = logging.getLogger("novaclient")</p>

    <p>logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)</p>

    <p>```</p>

    <p>The will print the same output as adding --debug option for command line API.</p>

    <h2>Debugging via Source Code</h2>

    <p>If the above techniques are still not helpful, you can always look at the source

    code to find the problems.</p>

    <p>The below source file structure is based on the installation in Ubuntu.</p>

    <p>The command line nova command is located in ''/usr/bin/nova''. By looking at
    this

    file, you should get a idea of how the various options are interpreted. This file

    acts as an interface for Python API.</p>

    <p>The Python API files are located under

    ''/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/novaclient'' and the most important file to
    look

    at is ''client.py''. This file does all the request preparation, sending request
    and

    receiving response. It is also used by the command line Nova client. </p>'

          : \n \n Pressing the \"+ Launch Stack\" button creates a dialogue that invites\
          \ you to\nprovide a Heat template. \n \n The dialogue offers you three ways\
          \ of providing a template via the \"Template Source\"\ndrop down: \n \n\
          \ \nURL - The template can be reached via a web browser, and you are going\

          \ dependant on which selection you make, the dialogue will reconfigure\n\
          itself to allow you to provide the required information. \n An environment\n\
          simply allows you to provide parameter values and to define custom resources.\
          \ \n In this example we are going to use one of the NeCTAR Heat sample templates.\
          \ \n So in the Template Source field select \"URL\", then in the \"Template\
          \ URL\" field\nenter: \n https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NeCTAR-RC/heat-templates/master/juno/Fedora/wordpress_single_instance.yaml\
          \ \n Then in the Environment Source field select \"Direct Input\", then\
          \ in the environment\ndata edit box type the following yaml (taking care\
          \ to enter the correct values): \n ``` \n parameters: \n # your nectar keypair\
          \ name instead of 'nectar_demo' \n key_name: nectar_demo \n # the latest\
          \ nectar fedora image id \n fedora_image_id: db354243-aba2-4831-81c7-a155b9089291\
          \ \n ``` \n Once you are done press the \"Next\" button. \n All going well,\
          \ you should now be presented with a page titled \"Launch Stack\".\nIt will\
          \ be a form that is made up of fields that are taken from your template's\n\
          parameters. \n Next to each field is a small question mark icon. As it gains\
          \ focus, so the user\nwill be shows the parameters comment field as a help\
          \ bubble to the right. \n \n The value entered into the \"Stack Name\" field\
          \ is used to give a name to the stack\nthat is going to be launched by Heat.\
          \ This name must start with a letter and may\nonly contain letters, numbers,\
          \ underscores, full stops and hyphens... \n The \"Creation Timeout (minutes)\"\
          \ field is the number of minutes that should be\nallowed for the stack creation\
          \ to take. If this time is exceeded then the stack\ncreation will be aborted.\
          \ \n The \"Rollback On Failure\" field, if checked, will ensure that the\
          \ complete\nstack gets deleted if there is a failure in creation. If it's\
          \ not checked then\nyou will have to manually delete the stack should there\
          \ be a failure in the creation. \n The rest of the fields are taken from\
          \ the template that has been uploaded.\nYou should find that the values\
          \ you entered in the environment file\nhave been used to fill the fields.\
          \ Otherwise, simply provide the requested\nvalues then select the \"Launch\"\
          \ button. \n All going well, the stack should be created. Once created you\
          \ can select it\nin the lists of stacks that are active, drilling down into\
          \ its\nparticular details. \n When you are finished with a stack, you can\
          \ simply hit the \"Delete\" button\nnext to it on the stack listings. If\

    <p>When you select it you will see a list of the stacks that you have created,\

    ></p>\n<p>Pressing the \"+ Launch Stack\" button creates a dialogue that invites\

    \ src=\"https://github.com/NeCTAR-RC/nectarcloud-tier0doco/blob/master/articles/Cloud\
    \ Expert--DOCID19/Heat--DOCID42/images/heat_dash_select_template.png?raw=true\"\
    ></p>\n<p>The dialogue offers you three ways of providing a template via the \"\
    Template Source\"\ndrop down:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>URL</code> - The template can\
    \ be reached via a web browser, and you are going to\n  provide the URL it can\
    \ be found at;</li>\n<li><code>File</code> - You are going to upload the template\
    \ from your local machine;</li>\n<li><code>Direct Input</code> - You will type\
    \ the template in by hand.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Dependent on which selection you make\
    \ in the \"Template Source\" drop down, the\ndialogue will reconfigure itself\
    \ to allow you to provide the required information.</p>\n<p>The dialogue also\
    \ offers you the chance to provide an \"Environment Source\".\nThis is also in\
    \ the form of a drop down, but here the choices are limited\nto:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>File</code>\
    \ - You are going to upload the environment from your local machine;</li>\n<li><code>Direct\
    \ Input</code> - You will type the environment in by hand.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Again,\
    \ dependant on which selection you make, the dialogue will reconfigure\nitself\
    \ to allow you to provide the required information.</p>\n<p>An <a href=\"http://docs.openstack.org/developer/heat/template_guide/environment.html\"\
    >environment</a>\nsimply allows you to provide parameter values and to define\
    \ custom resources.</p>\n<p>In this example we are going to use one of the NeCTAR\
    \ Heat sample templates.</p>\n<p>So in the Template Source field select \"URL\"\
    , then in the \"Template URL\" field\nenter:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NeCTAR-RC/heat-templates/master/juno/Fedora/wordpress_single_instance.yaml\"\
    >https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NeCTAR-RC/heat-templates/master/juno/Fedora/wordpress_single_instance.yaml</a></p>\n\
    <p>Then in the Environment Source field select \"Direct Input\", then in the environment\n\
    data edit box type the following <code>yaml</code> (taking care to enter the correct\
    \ values):</p>\n<p>```</p>\n<p>parameters:</p>\n<p># your nectar keypair name\
    \ instead of 'nectar_demo'</p>\n<p>key_name: nectar_demo</p>\n<p># the latest\
    \ nectar fedora image id</p>\n<p>fedora_image_id: db354243-aba2-4831-81c7-a155b9089291</p>\n\
    <p>```</p>\n<p>Once you are done press the \"Next\" button.</p>\n<p>All going\
    \ well, you should now be presented with a page titled \"Launch Stack\".\nIt will\
    \ be a form that is made up of fields that are taken from your template's\nparameters.</p>\n\
    <p>Next to each field is a small question mark icon. As it gains focus, so the\
    \ user\nwill be shows the parameters comment field as a help bubble to the right.</p>\n\
    <p><img alt=\"Heat launch template dialog\" src=\"https://github.com/NeCTAR-RC/nectarcloud-tier0doco/blob/master/articles/Cloud\
    \ Expert--DOCID19/Heat--DOCID42/images/heat_dash_launch.png?raw=true\"></p>\n\
    <p>The value entered into the \"Stack Name\" field is used to give a name to the\
    \ stack\nthat is going to be launched by Heat. This name must start with a letter\
    \ and may\nonly contain letters, numbers, underscores, full stops and hyphens...</p>\n\
    <p>The \"Creation Timeout (minutes)\" field is the number of minutes that should\
    \ be\nallowed for the stack creation to take. If this time is exceeded then the\
    \ stack\ncreation will be aborted.</p>\n<p>The \"Rollback On Failure\" field,\
    \ if checked, will ensure that the complete\nstack gets deleted if there is a\
    \ failure in creation. If it's not checked then\nyou will have to manually delete\
    \ the stack should there be a failure in the creation.</p>\n<p>The rest of the\
    \ fields are taken from the template that has been uploaded.\nYou should find\
    \ that the values you entered in the environment file\nhave been used to fill\
    \ the fields. Otherwise, simply provide the requested\nvalues then select the\
    \ \"Launch\" button.</p>\n<p>All going well, the stack should be created. Once\
    \ created you can select it\nin the lists of stacks that are active, drilling\
    \ down into its\nparticular details.</p>\n<p>When you are finished with a stack,\
    \ you can simply hit the \"Delete\" button\nnext to it on the stack listings.\
    \ If you want to delete more than one\nstack, select the checkboxes next to them\
    \ and hit the \"\u2716 Delete Stack\"\nbutton.</p>"

          \ have installed swift command client in a Linux\nenvironment. If you have\
          \ other operating systems, the debugging process might be\nslightly different,\
          \ however the general rules should still apply. \n Swift command line client\
          \ is very much like other Linux commands; error messages\nare sent to standard\
          \ output, which is the monitor. \n If you get an error, you can always read\
          \ the error message and generally it will\ngive you very good hints about\
          \ what might be wrong. \n For example, if you execute swift list on the\
          \ command line without\nauthentication, the error message might look like\
          \ this: \n \n Auth version 1.0 requires ST_AUTH, ST_USER, and ST_KEY environment\
          \ variables\nto be set or overridden with -A, -U, or -K. \n Auth version\
          \ 2.0 requires OS_AUTH_URL, OS_USERNAME, OS_PASSWORD, and\nOS_TENANT_NAME\
          \ OS_TENANT_ID to be set or overridden with --os-auth-url,\n--os-username,\
          \ --os-password, --os-tenant-name or os-tenant-id. Note:\nadding \"-V 2\"\
          \ is necessary for this. \n \n The above message indicates you that there\
          \ are 2 authentication versions that\nswift currently supports and each\
          \ version requires some environment variables\nto be set. To set these environment\
          \ variables you can either source the script\nfile downloaded from NeCTAR\
          \ Dashboard or you can override it by\nusing command line options. \n You\
          \ can always execute man swift or simply swift to get more help\ninformation\
          \ and to learn about supported options. \n If you find a useful command,\

          <p>The below assumes you have installed swift command client in a Linux

          environment. If you have other operating systems, the debugging process
          might be

          slightly different, however the general rules should still apply.</p>

          <p>Swift command line client is very much like other Linux commands; error
          messages

          are sent to standard output, which is the monitor.</p>

          <p>If you get an error, you can always read the error message and generally
          it will

          give you very good hints about what might be wrong.</p>

          <p>For example, if you execute <code>swift list</code> on the command line
          without

          authentication, the error message might look like this:</p>

          <blockquote>

          <p>Auth version 1.0 requires ST_AUTH, ST_USER, and ST_KEY environment variables

          to be set or overridden with -A, -U, or -K.</p>

          <p>Auth version 2.0 requires OS_AUTH_URL, OS_USERNAME, OS_PASSWORD, and

          OS_TENANT_NAME OS_TENANT_ID to be set or overridden with --os-auth-url,

          --os-username, --os-password, --os-tenant-name or os-tenant-id. Note:

          adding "-V 2" is necessary for this.</p>

          </blockquote>

          <p>The above message indicates you that there are 2 authentication versions
          that

          swift currently supports and each version requires some environment variables

          to be set. To set these environment variables you can either source the
          script

          file downloaded from NeCTAR <a href="https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au">Dashboard</a>
          or you can override it by

          using command line options.</p>

          <p>You can always execute <code>man swift</code> or simply <code>swift</code>
          to get more help

          information and to learn about supported options.</p>

          <p>If you find a useful command, you can also execute <code>swift command
          --help</code>,

          this will give you more specific help for the command.</p>

    central space that shows your dashboard information. On the overview screen\n\
    this information consists of pie charts indicating the resource usage (e.g.\n\
    number VCPUs in use) in your allocation. An important part of your dashboard\n\
    is the <strong>Project Selector</strong> on the top left hand side: if you manage\

          \ \n \n \n Login to NeCTAR Dashboard \n \n \n Select a project from the\
          \ project drop down list and click 'Access & Security',\n your screen should\

          <p>Authentication is the process of verifying the identify of a user that
          is requesting

          to access a computer system. In the context of NeCTAR Cloud, the identities
          of

          users or host computers must be established before accessing the Cloud resources

          such as Dashboard, APIs, Virtual Machines, etc.</p>

          <h2>Methods of Authentication</h2>

          <p>The NecTAR Cloud uses three basic types of authentication for users to
          access

          the Cloud: single sign on authentication (AAF), SSH based authentication

          for virtual machines and token based authentication for APIs.</p>

          <h3>Single Sign on Authentication</h3>

          <p>Single sign on authentication is the process that gives users the ability
          to access

          distributed multiple protected computer system with a single authentication.

          NeCTAR Cloud uses Australian Access Federation (AAF) as the single sign
          on

          authentication solution for access of the Dashboard. The AAF provides the
          ability

          for users to log into a number of eResearch services including NeCTAR Cloud
          using

          the same username and password you would usually use when logging into your

          institution''s or organization''s computer system. The authentications involves

          2 steps, select your institution or organization and provide your username/password.

          <h3>SSH Based Authentication</h3>

          <p>SSH (Secure SHell) based authentication is an alternative way to identify

          yourself to a computer service, rather than typing a username and password.
          It

          is more secure and flexible, but more difficult to set up.</p>

          <p>You generate a key pair, consisting of public key and a private key.
          The private

          key can generate an unique signature and only the relevant public key can

          verify if the signature is genuine.</p>

          <p>After generating a key pair, you copy the public the key to the Virtual
          Machine.

          Then, when the Virtual Machines asks you to prove who you are, you use

          the private key to sign a message and the Virtual Machine can verify the

          signature and allow you to log in. Even if the Virtual Machine is hacked
          and

          your public key is stolen, the public key cannot be used to do authentication

          and you are still safe.</p>

          <p>By default, virtual machines in NeCTAR Cloud uses this authentication
          method and

          it requires you to generate a public/private key pairs before you can login.</p>

          <p>NeCTAR Cloud APIs use Token based authentication. The token is temporary
          and

          short lived, which means it is safer to cache them than username/password

        desc_un_html: " Security API \n The NeCTAR Cloud doesn't provide a specific\
          \ API for security purposes. The only\nsecurity relevant operation is to\
          \ manage security groups through the Nova API.\nIf you want to know the\
          \ Nova API, You can find the related information from the\narticles in the\
          \ 'Instance Management' section. \n This article describes some techniques\
          \ to help you to secure a Linux based\nvirtual machine in the NeCTAR cloud.\
          \ \n As security is a very broad topic, the techniques showed here only\
          \ provides a\nbasic introduction. You can always go to Internet and find\
          \ more useful information\nabout security. \n The instructions below assume\
          \ your operating system is debian/ubuntu. \n Securing SSH \n You need to\
          \ encourage all the users on your system to use SSH certificate\nauthentication\
          \ and disable password login. In addition, you need to avoid logging\ninto\
          \ the system using SSH as root and use alternative methods to become root,\n\
          such as su or sudo. \n To change the SSH configuration, you can edit the\
          \ configuration file on the virtual\nmachine, in '/etc/ssh/sshd_config'.\
          \ \n A basic description of some important configuration items: \n \n \n\
          \ PermitRootLogin no \n You need to set this to 'no' to avoid root access\
          \ via SSH \n \n \n Port 22 \n For better security, you can change the SSH\
          \ port to other port number \n \n \n PermitEmptyPasswords no \n  This should\
          \ be always 'no', for non-empty password access \n \n \n AllowUsers \n \
          \ This directive allows only certain users to have access via SSH to this\
          \ machine. \n \n \n PasswordAuthentication no \n  You should set this to\
          \ 'no' to disable user loggin using password \n \n \n After you have changed\
          \ the '/etc/ssh/sshd_config file', you can execute sudo service ssh restart\n\
          to apply the new changes. \n If you are using an SSH client to access your\
          \ Virtual Machine, you need to make\nsure both SSH server and client are\
          \ using the same version of protocols. \n You can also restrict access to\
          \ file transfer only if you want to allow accounts\non your Virtual Machine\
          \ to transfer files. You can do it by giving users a\nrestricted shell such\
          \ as scpoly or rssh. These shells restrict the commands\navailable to the\
          \ users to execute. You can change an account's shell by editing\n'/etc/passwd'\
          \ file. \n Securing Apache \n If you don't want your Apache web service\
          \ available to public, you can use the\nListen or BindAddress directives\
          \ in '/etc/apache2/apache2.conf'. \n Using Listen:\n    Listen 127.0.0.1:80\n\
          Using BindAddress:\n    BindAddress 127.0.0.1 \n Then you can restart your\
          \ apache service with sudo service apache2 restart \n The default Apache\
          \ installation in Debian permits users to publish content\nunder the '$HOME/public_html'.\
          \ This content can be retrieved remotely using an\nURL such as: http://your_apache_server/~user.\
          \ \n You can restrict the default configuration by editing '/etc/apache2/mods-enabled/userdir.conf'\
          \ \n You can also make sure the permission of log files can only be read/write\
          \ by the\nrequired user and groups. The default permission for the log files\
          \ may be readable\nby anyone. \n By default, Apache web files are located\
          \ under /'var/www'. The default file provides\nsome hints on the system\
          \ like what is the operating system. You should substitute\nthe default\
          \ web pages with your own. \n To further strengthen the Apache security,\
          \ you can run Apache by chroot. See this\ninstruction to set up Apache.\
          \ \n Keep System Update to Date \n In debian/ubuntu, you run sudo apt-get\
          \ update regularly to keep system\nsecurity patch update to date. \n Setup\
          \ Local Firewall \n A local firewall can also be installed with filtering\
          \ rules to protect access to\nthe system. You can use IPtable tools to create\
          \ rules to filter network traffic.\nIt is advised to use Security Group\
          \ to manage which ports to open as it is simple\nto do. The below only provides\
          \ basic introduction to IPtables, for more\ninformation, please refer to\
          \ IPtables MAN page. \n To list all current rules, execute:  sudo iptables\
          \ --list \n By default, the IPtables defines 3 chains. The INPUT Chain is\
          \ for incoming traffic\n, the Forward Chain is for forwarded traffic and\
          \ the OUTPUT Chain is for outgoing\ntraffic. Which chains you need to add\
          \ rules depends on what traffic you want to\nfilter. \n IPtables also defines\
          \ policies that defines actions for rules: \n \n \n Accept, accept traffic\
          \ \n \n \n Reject, reject traffic by sending back an error packet \n \n\
          \ \n Drop, reject traffic by dropping traffic \n \n \n The below shows an\
          \ example how to enable SSH and HTTP/HTTPS traffic in IPtables. \n Firstly,\
          \ you need to allow connections that are already connected to your server:\
          \ \n sudo iptables - I INPUT 1 -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT \n Secondly,\
          \ you need to allow SSH connections: \n sudo iptables -I INPUT 1 -p tcp\
          \ --dport 22 -j ACCEPT \n Thirdly, you can allow HTTP/HTTPS traffic: \n\
          \ sudo iptables -I INPUT 1 -p tcp -dport 80 -j ACCEPT\nsudo iptables -I\
          \ INPUT 1 -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT \n Finally, you need to drop all\
          \ other traffic. You need to make sure you have set\nto allow SSH connection,\
          \ otherwise you will lose access to the Virtual Machine: \n sudo iptables\
          \ -P INPUT DROP \n You can save your IPtables changes by (Ubuntu):  \n iptables-save\
          \ > /etc/iptables.rules \n Install fail2ban \n The SSH daemon itself is\
          \ a Linux service that exposed to the Internet and creates\na security risk\
          \ for the system. fail2ban can mitigate this problem by creating\nrules\
          \ that can automatically alter your your IPtables firewall and ban\nunsuccessful\
          \ login attempts based on a predefined number.  \n You can use the below\
          \ commands to install fail2ban in Ubuntu: \n sudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get\
          \ install fail2ban \n To setup the fail2ban, please follow this instruction.\
          \ \n Disable Unneeded Services \n Unneeded services are a potential security\
          \ risk, so you can execute sudo service --status-all\nto list all available\
          \ services.  You can examine the output carefully and disable\nany services\
          \ not desired. "

          \ 1 -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT</code></p>\n<p>Finally, you need to drop\
          \ all other traffic. You need to make sure you have set\nto allow SSH connection,\
          \ otherwise you will lose access to the Virtual Machine:</p>\n<p><code>sudo\
          \ iptables -P INPUT DROP</code></p>\n<p>You can save your IPtables changes\

  html: "<h2>Security API</h2>\n<p>The NeCTAR Cloud doesn't provide a specific API\
    \ for security purposes. The only\nsecurity relevant operation is to manage security\
    \ groups through the Nova API.\nIf you want to know the Nova API, You can find\
    \ the related information from the\narticles in the 'Instance Management' section.</p>\n\
    <p>This article describes some techniques to help you to secure a Linux based\n\
    virtual machine in the NeCTAR cloud.</p>\n<p>As security is a very broad topic,\
    \ the techniques showed here only provides a\nbasic introduction. You can always\
    \ go to Internet and find more useful information\nabout security.</p>\n<p>The\
    \ instructions below assume your operating system is debian/ubuntu.</p>\n<h2>Securing\
    \ SSH</h2>\n<p>You need to encourage all the users on your system to use SSH certificate\n\
    authentication and disable password login. In addition, you need to avoid logging\n\
    into the system using SSH as root and use alternative methods to become root,\n\
    such as su or sudo.</p>\n<p>To change the SSH configuration, you can edit the\
    \ configuration file on the virtual\nmachine, in '/etc/ssh/sshd_config'.</p>\n\
    <p>A basic description of some important configuration items:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n\
    <p><strong>PermitRootLogin</strong> <strong><em>no</em></strong><br>\n You need\
    \ to set this to 'no' to avoid root access via SSH</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Port\
    \ 22</strong><br>\n For better security, you can change the SSH port to other\
    \ port number</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>PermitEmptyPasswords</strong> <strong><em>no</em></strong><br>\n\
    \  This should be always 'no', for non-empty password access</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\
    <p><strong>AllowUsers</strong><br>\n  This directive allows only certain users\
    \ to have access via SSH to this machine.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>PasswordAuthentication</strong>\
    \ <strong><em>no</em></strong><br>\n  You should set this to 'no' to disable user\
    \ loggin using password</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After you have changed the '/etc/ssh/sshd_config\
    \ file', you can execute <code>sudo service ssh restart</code>\nto apply the new\
    \ changes.</p>\n<p>If you are using an SSH client to access your Virtual Machine,\
    \ you need to make\nsure both SSH server and client are using the same version\
    \ of protocols.</p>\n<p>You can also restrict access to file transfer only if\
    \ you want to allow accounts\non your Virtual Machine to transfer files. You can\
    \ do it by giving users a\nrestricted shell such as scpoly or rssh. These shells\
    \ restrict the commands\navailable to the users to execute. You can change an\
    \ account's shell by editing\n'/etc/passwd' file.</p>\n<h2>Securing Apache</h2>\n\
    <p>If you don't want your Apache web service available to public, you can use\
    \ the\nListen or BindAddress directives in '/etc/apache2/apache2.conf'.</p>\n\
    <p>Using Listen:\n    Listen 127.0.0.1:80\nUsing BindAddress:\n    BindAddress\
    \ 127.0.0.1</p>\n<p>Then you can restart your apache service with <code>sudo service\
    \ apache2 restart</code></p>\n<p>The default Apache installation in Debian permits\
    \ users to publish content\nunder the '$HOME/public_html'. This content can be\
    \ retrieved remotely using an\nURL such as: http://your_apache_server/~user.</p>\n\
    <p>You can restrict the default configuration by editing '/etc/apache2/mods-enabled/userdir.conf'</p>\n\
    <p>You can also make sure the permission of log files can only be read/write by\
    \ the\nrequired user and groups. The default permission for the log files may\
    \ be readable\nby anyone.</p>\n<p>By default, Apache web files are located under\
    \ /'var/www'. The default file provides\nsome hints on the system like what is\
    \ the operating system. You should substitute\nthe default web pages with your\
    \ own.</p>\n<p>To further strengthen the Apache security, you can run Apache by\
    \ chroot. See this\n<a href=\"https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ap-chroot-apache-env.en.html\"\
    >instruction</a> to set up Apache.</p>\n<h2>Keep System Update to Date</h2>\n\
    <p>In debian/ubuntu, you run <code>sudo apt-get update</code> regularly to keep\
    \ system\nsecurity patch update to date.</p>\n<h2>Setup Local Firewall</h2>\n\
    <p>A local firewall can also be installed with filtering rules to protect access\
    \ to\nthe system. You can use IPtable tools to create rules to filter network\
    \ traffic.\nIt is advised to use Security Group to manage which ports to open\
    \ as it is simple\nto do. The below only provides basic introduction to IPtables,\
    \ for more\ninformation, please refer to IPtables <a href=\"http://linux.die.net/man/8/iptables\"\
    >MAN page</a>.</p>\n<p>To list all current rules, execute:  <code>sudo iptables\
    \ --list</code></p>\n<p>By default, the IPtables defines 3 chains. The INPUT Chain\
    \ is for incoming traffic\n, the Forward Chain is for forwarded traffic and the\
    \ OUTPUT Chain is for outgoing\ntraffic. Which chains you need to add rules depends\
    \ on what traffic you want to\nfilter.</p>\n<p>IPtables also defines policies\
    \ that defines actions for rules:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Accept</strong>,\
    \ accept traffic</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Reject</strong>, reject traffic\
    \ by sending back an error packet</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Drop</strong>,\
    \ reject traffic by dropping traffic</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The below shows an\
    \ example how to enable SSH and HTTP/HTTPS traffic in IPtables.</p>\n<p>Firstly,\
    \ you need to allow connections that are already connected to your server:</p>\n\
    <p><code>sudo iptables - I INPUT 1 -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT</code></p>\n<p>Secondly,\
    \ you need to allow SSH connections:</p>\n<p><code>sudo iptables -I INPUT 1 -p\
    \ tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT</code></p>\n<p>Thirdly, you can allow HTTP/HTTPS traffic:</p>\n\
    <p><code>sudo iptables -I INPUT 1 -p tcp -dport 80 -j ACCEPT</code>\n<code>sudo\
    \ iptables -I INPUT 1 -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT</code></p>\n<p>Finally, you\
    \ need to drop all other traffic. You need to make sure you have set\nto allow\
    \ SSH connection, otherwise you will lose access to the Virtual Machine:</p>\n\
    <p><code>sudo iptables -P INPUT DROP</code></p>\n<p>You can save your IPtables\
    \ changes by (Ubuntu): </p>\n<p><code>iptables-save &gt; /etc/iptables.rules</code></p>\n\

        desc_un_html: " Debugging Dashboard Authentication \n The NeCTAR Dashboard\
          \ uses Australian Access Federation for its authentication.\nIf you have\
          \ any problems with the login, you can contact the IT helpdesk in your\n\
          local organization or institution. You can log a ticket in the NeCTAR\n\
          helpdesk. You can also submit a help request to aaf\nhelpdesk for help.\
          \ \n Debugging API Authentication \n You must first send an authentication\
          \ request to OpenStack Identity service to\nget an authentication token\
          \ before you can access API services. To request an\nauthentication token,\
          \ you must supply the credentials in the authentication request. \n The\
          \ credentials are a combination of username, password and project name.\
          \ You also\nneed to get the authentication URL for credentials validation.\
          \ \n You need to make sure you have the correct Credentials download from\
          \ the NeCTAR\nDashboard. Before you use them, please check the username,\
          \ projet name and the\nAPI endpoints. You can reference these information\
          \ from the script file you\nobtained from the NeCTAR Dashboard. \n After\
          \ you send the username/password and project name to the authentication\
          \ URL,\nYou will get a authentication token. Then, you need to include the\
          \ token in the\nX-Auth-Token HTTP header. If you access multiple API services,\
          \ you must get a\ntoken for each API service. The token has a limited time\
          \ and can become invalid\nfor other reasons. \n Authentication and API request\
          \ workflow \n \n \n Send a request with credentials to get a token from\
          \ the Identity endpoint. If\n the request succeeds, the server returns an\
          \ authentication token. \n \n \n Send API requests and include the token\
          \ in the X-Auth-Token HTTP header. The\n following HTTP requests use the\
          \ same token until the requests complete. \n \n \n If a 401 Unauthorized\
          \ error returned, the request requires a new token. \n \n \n Debug Authentication\
          \ \n The below use cURL commands to show your how to debug authentication\
          \ request.\nFor information about cURL, see http://curl.haxx.se/. For information\n\
          about the OpenStack APIs, see OpenStack API Reference. \n To get a valid\
          \ token, you need 3 parameters: \n \n \n username \n \n \n password \n \n\
          \ \n project name/project id \n \n \n The below shows a code to get token:\
          \ \n ``` \n curl -s -X POST https://keystone.rc.nectar.org.au:5000/v2.0/tokens\
          \ \\ \n         -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n\n        -d '{\"\
          auth\": {\"tenantName\": \"'\"$OS_TENANT_NAME\"'\", \"passwordCredentials\"\
          :\n\n        {\"username\": \"'\"$OS_USERNAME\"'\", \"password\": \"'\"\
          $OS_PASSWORD\"'\"}}}' \\\n\n        | python -m json.tool\n \n ``` \n You\
          \ need to replace the username, password and tenantname with the values\
          \ in\nthe authentication script file you obtained from the NeCTAR Dashboard.\
          \ \n The response would look like below: \n ``` \n {\n    \"access\": {\n\

        description: "<h2>Debugging Dashboard Authentication</h2>\n<p>The NeCTAR Dashboard\
          \ uses <a href=\"http://aaf.edu.au/\">Australian Access Federation</a> for\
          \ its authentication.\nIf you have any problems with the login, you can\
          \ contact the IT helpdesk in your\nlocal organization or institution. You\
          \ can log a ticket in the NeCTAR\n<a href=\"https://support.nectar.org.au/support/home\"\
          >helpdesk</a>. You can also submit a help request to aaf\n<a href=\"http://support.aaf.edu.au/home\"\
          >helpdesk</a> for help.</p>\n<h2>Debugging API Authentication</h2>\n<p>You\
          \ must first send an authentication request to OpenStack Identity service\
          \ to\nget an authentication token before you can access API services. To\
          \ request an\nauthentication token, you must supply the credentials in the\
          \ authentication request.</p>\n<p>The credentials are a combination of username,\
          \ password and project name. You also\nneed to get the authentication URL\
          \ for credentials validation.</p>\n<p>You need to make sure you have the\
          \ correct Credentials download from the NeCTAR\nDashboard. Before you use\
          \ them, please check the username, projet name and the\nAPI endpoints. You\
          \ can reference these information from the script file you\nobtained from\
          \ the NeCTAR Dashboard.</p>\n<p>After you send the username/password and\
          \ project name to the authentication URL,\nYou will get a authentication\
          \ token. Then, you need to include the token in the\nX-Auth-Token HTTP header.\
          \ If you access multiple API services, you must get a\ntoken for each API\
          \ service. The token has a limited time and can become invalid\nfor other\
          \ reasons.</p>\n<h3>Authentication and API request workflow</h3>\n<ul>\n\
          <li>\n<p>Send a request with credentials to get a token from the Identity\
          \ endpoint. If\n the request succeeds, the server returns an authentication\
          \ token.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Send API requests and include the token in\
          \ the X-Auth-Token HTTP header. The\n following HTTP requests use the same\
          \ token until the requests complete.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If a 401 Unauthorized\
          \ error returned, the request requires a new token.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\
          <h3>Debug Authentication</h3>\n<p>The below use cURL commands to show your\
          \ how to debug authentication request.\nFor information about cURL, see\
          \ <a href=\"http://curl.haxx.se/\">http://curl.haxx.se/</a>. For information\n\
          about the OpenStack APIs, see <a href=\"http://developer.openstack.org/api-ref.html\"\
          >OpenStack API Reference</a>.</p>\n<p>To get a valid token, you need 3 parameters:</p>\n\
          <ul>\n<li>\n<p>username</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>password</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\
          <p>project name/project id</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The below shows a code\
          \ to get token:</p>\n<p>```</p>\n<p>curl -s -X POST https://keystone.rc.nectar.org.au:5000/v2.0/tokens\

  html: "<h2>Debugging Dashboard Authentication</h2>\n<p>The NeCTAR Dashboard uses\
    \ <a href=\"http://aaf.edu.au/\">Australian Access Federation</a> for its authentication.\n\
    If you have any problems with the login, you can contact the IT helpdesk in your\n\
    local organization or institution. You can log a ticket in the NeCTAR\n<a href=\"\
    https://support.nectar.org.au/support/home\">helpdesk</a>. You can also submit\
    \ a help request to aaf\n<a href=\"http://support.aaf.edu.au/home\">helpdesk</a>\
    \ for help.</p>\n<h2>Debugging API Authentication</h2>\n<p>You must first send\
    \ an authentication request to OpenStack Identity service to\nget an authentication\
    \ token before you can access API services. To request an\nauthentication token,\
    \ you must supply the credentials in the authentication request.</p>\n<p>The credentials\
    \ are a combination of username, password and project name. You also\nneed to\
    \ get the authentication URL for credentials validation.</p>\n<p>You need to make\
    \ sure you have the correct Credentials download from the NeCTAR\nDashboard. Before\
    \ you use them, please check the username, projet name and the\nAPI endpoints.\
    \ You can reference these information from the script file you\nobtained from\
    \ the NeCTAR Dashboard.</p>\n<p>After you send the username/password and project\
    \ name to the authentication URL,\nYou will get a authentication token. Then,\
    \ you need to include the token in the\nX-Auth-Token HTTP header. If you access\
    \ multiple API services, you must get a\ntoken for each API service. The token\
    \ has a limited time and can become invalid\nfor other reasons.</p>\n<h3>Authentication\
    \ and API request workflow</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Send a request with credentials\
    \ to get a token from the Identity endpoint. If\n the request succeeds, the server\
    \ returns an authentication token.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Send API requests and\
    \ include the token in the X-Auth-Token HTTP header. The\n following HTTP requests\
    \ use the same token until the requests complete.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If a 401\
    \ Unauthorized error returned, the request requires a new token.</p>\n</li>\n\
    </ul>\n<h3>Debug Authentication</h3>\n<p>The below use cURL commands to show your\
    \ how to debug authentication request.\nFor information about cURL, see <a href=\"\
    http://curl.haxx.se/\">http://curl.haxx.se/</a>. For information\nabout the OpenStack\
    \ APIs, see <a href=\"http://developer.openstack.org/api-ref.html\">OpenStack\
    \ API Reference</a>.</p>\n<p>To get a valid token, you need 3 parameters:</p>\n\
    <ul>\n<li>\n<p>username</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>password</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>project\
    \ name/project id</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The below shows a code to get token:</p>\n\
    <p>```</p>\n<p>curl -s -X POST https://keystone.rc.nectar.org.au:5000/v2.0/tokens\
    \ \\</p>\n<pre><code>        -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n\n    \
    \    -d '{\"auth\": {\"tenantName\": \"'\"$OS_TENANT_NAME\"'\", \"passwordCredentials\"\
    :\n\n        {\"username\": \"'\"$OS_USERNAME\"'\", \"password\": \"'\"$OS_PASSWORD\"\
    '\"}}}' \\\n\n        | python -m json.tool\n</code></pre>\n<p>```</p>\n<p>You\
    \ need to replace the username, password and tenantname with the values in\nthe\
    \ authentication script file you obtained from the NeCTAR Dashboard.</p>\n<p>The\
    \ response would look like below:</p>\n<p>```</p>\n<p>{\n    \"access\": {\n \
    \       \"metadata\": {\n            \"is_admin\": 0,\n            \"roles\":\

    user\": {\n            \"id\": \"\",\n            \"name\": \"\",\n          \

    \      \"username\": \"\"\n        }\n    }\n}</p>\n<p>```</p>\n<p>Then you can\
    \ use the token obtained from this output in the API for authentication.</p>\n\
    <p>Following is an example of how to use the token in using Nova API to list flavors:</p>\n\
    <p>```</p>\n<p>curl -s -H \\</p>\n<pre><code>        \"X-Auth-Token:token\" \\\
    \n\n        http://8.21.28.222:8774/v2/tenant_id/flavors \\\n\n        | python\
    \ -m json.tool\n</code></pre>\n<p>```</p>\n<p>You need to replace the token and\
    \ the URL. You can find the Nova API endpoint\nURL from the NeCTAR <a href=\"\
    https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au\">Dashboard</a>. The above request would return\
    \ the\nfollowing output:</p>\n<p>```</p>\n<p>{\n    \"flavors\": [\n        {\n\

          \ Storage \n Backing Up Data \n \n See Training Module 9 for more detail\
          \ on snapshots and backups. \n About Snapshots \n A snapshot is a way to\
          \ create a copy of the disk state of your virtual machine (VM). \nThere\
          \ are two main reasons you would take a snapshot of your VM: \n \n To back-up\
          \ the VM set-up - you can restore an instance from the snapshot \n To create\
          \ a template image which can be used to launch instances which are already\
          \ set-up. \n \n NOTE: The snapshot only creates an image of the primary\
          \ 'root' disk, not the secondary 'ephemeral' storage or mounted volumes.\
          \ \n The primary 'root' disk is small (5-30GB) and is not suitable for storing\
          \ significant data. \nCreating an image of your VM is preserving the computer\
          \ set-up such as software installation,\nconfigurations and profiles. Backing\
          \ up data will be covered later in this article. \n \n Creating a Snapshot\
          \ of an Instance (an Image) \n \n Log on to the NeCTAR Dashboard and click\
          \ on the 'Instances' tab \n It is not necessary, but good practice, to 'pause\
          \ instance' from the 'Actions' drop down list. \n Click 'Create Snapshot'\
          \ from the 'Actions' drop down list. \n Enter a descriptive name for the\
          \ Snapshot \n It will now take some time to create the Snapshot.  \n The\
          \ snapshotted image will be saved in the 'Project' tab of the 'Images' section.\
          \ \n \n Launching an Instance from a saved Image \n \n On the NeCTAR Dashboard,\
          \ navigate to 'Images'\n \n Choose the 'Project' tab \n Click 'Launch' in\
          \ the 'Actions' list for the image you wish to restore. \n You can choose\
          \ a different 'Flavour' (i.e. size) of instance, but it must be large \n\
          \ enough to fit the image on the primary 'root' disk. \n Name the instance,\
          \ set the keypair and security groups in the 'Access and Security' tab,\n\
          \ and set the 'Availability Zone' if necessary (e.g. to ensure the same\
          \ zone as your volume storage). \n This is just like launching a new instance,\
          \ except that the new VM will already have the settings,\n configurations\
          \ and installations of the original VM. \n Access as per usual, with SSH\
          \ keys and the IP address of the new instance. \n \n NOTE: The new VM will\
          \ have a new, empty secondary 'ephemeral' storage disk. This will\nneed\
          \ to be made writable with the command: \nsudo chown ubuntu /mnt \n If required,\
          \ existing volume storage will need to be attached, mounted and made writable\
          \ also.  \nAttach on the NeCTAR Dashboard -> Volumes -> Edit Attachments\
          \ \nThen access the VM command line and enter: \nsudo mkdir /volume_name\
          \ \nsudo mount /dev/vdc /volume_name -t auto \nsudo chown ubuntu /volume_name\
          \ \n \n \n Snapshots of Volume Storage \n Snapshots can also be made to\
          \ copy the disk state of your Volume block storage.\nThis is useful for\
          \ preserving the state of your Volume in an image, in order to \ncreate\
          \ a new Volume from it at a later time. The volume snapshots use up your\
          \ volume\ndata allocation, for the full size of the volume. Volume snapshots\
          \ are not designed as a method of\nbacking up data - see data backup suggestions\
          \ later in this article. \n \n On the NeCTAR Dashboard, navigate to 'Volumes'\n\
          \ \n The volume should be unnattached from an instance: Click 'Edit Attachments'\n\
          \ in the 'Actions' list, then 'Detach Volume'. \n Click 'Create Snapshot'\
          \ in the 'Actions' list. \n \n The snapshot is found in the 'Volume Snapshots'\
          \ tab. \n \n \n In the 'Actions' drop down list, you can create a new volume\
          \ from the snapshot,\n edit the name, or delete the snapshot when it is\
          \ no longer needed (to recover the volume storage space it uses). \n \n\
          \ \n \n Backing Up your Data \n \n As discussed earlier in this article,\
          \ Instance snapshots don't copy the larger disks\nthat are used for data\
          \ storage, and Volume snapshots are inefficient as a data back-up strategy.\
          \ \n The source for the back-up will be the secondary 'ephemeral' storage\
          \ disk, or\nfrom volume block storage. \n The destination for the back-up\
          \ may be your local computer, or a data storage \nserver at your research\
          \ organisation. \n Compressed File Transfers \n The simplest back-up is\
          \ to compress a directory and transfer it from your VM to your back-up destination.\
          \ \n The general comand structure to compress files: \ntar -cvpzf <NameOfArchive>.tar.gz\
          \ <list of your files or folders> \n To copy a directory ( /mnt/data ) into\
          \ a single, compressed file ( data.tar.gz ):  \n tar -cvpzf data.tar.gz\
          \ /mnt/data \n The compressed file can be transferred to another computer\
          \ using FileZilla (for a local\ncomputer back-up), or SCP to back-up on\
          \ a remote server (see the Cloud Basics article: Transferring Data) \n scp\
          \ <Path_To_Source_File> <Path_to_Destination>   \n e.g. scp ~/data.tar.gz\
          \ username@remote.host.edu.au:data/directory \nor, scp -i path/to/key ~/data.tar.gz\
          \ username@remote.host.edu.au:data/directory  \n Backing up with RSYNC \n\
          \ This is a utility that creates incremental backups, such that the most\
          \ recent synced state \nof a source directory is 'mirrored' in a directory\
          \ on the destination storage device. \n Syncing is a more efficient way\
          \ of backing up data, as after the first sync, only modifications to the\
          \ files will be transferred. \n \n RSYNC must be installed on the source\
          \ computer (the VM) and the destination computer. \n RSYNC is pre-installed\
          \ on MacOSX \n On Ubuntu, enter sudo apt-get install rsync\n \n On Windows,\
          \ installation is through the Cygwin package and usage is more complicated.\
          \ \n \n The general command for creating or syncing the back-up:   \n rsync\
          \ -av <source directory> <destination directory> \nor, \nrsync -av -e -i\
          \ <path-to-private-key> <source directory> <destination directory> \n To\
          \ sync from the Terminal app. on your local computer, from the directory\
          \ you are syncing into: \n rsync -av ubuntu@NNN.NNN.NNN.NNN:/mnt/data/ dataCopy/\
          \  (this syncs data from the VM) \nrsync -av dataCopy/ ubuntu@NNN.NNN.NNN.NNN:/mnt/data/\
          \ (this will restore data to the VM) \n To sync from the VM command line\

          <p>A snapshot is a way to create a copy of the disk state of your virtual\
          \ machine (VM).<br>\nThere are two main reasons you would take a snapshot\
          \ of your VM:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>To <strong>back-up the VM set-up</strong> -\
          \ you can restore an instance from the snapshot</li>\n<li>To create a <strong>template\
          \ image</strong> which can be used to launch instances which are already\
          \ set-up.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>NOTE: The snapshot only creates an image of the\
          \ primary 'root' disk, not the secondary 'ephemeral' storage or mounted\
          \ volumes.</p>\n<p>The primary 'root' disk is small (5-30GB) and is not\
          \ suitable for storing significant data. \nCreating an image of your VM\
          \ is preserving the computer set-up such as software installation,\nconfigurations\
          \ and profiles. <a href=\"#Backup\">Backing up data will be covered later\
          \ in this article</a>.</p>\n<p><a name=\"Instance\"></a></p>\n<h2>Creating\
          \ a Snapshot of an Instance (an Image)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Log on to the <a\
          \ href=\"https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au\">NeCTAR Dashboard</a> and click\
          \ on the <strong>'Instances'</strong> tab</li>\n<li>It is not necessary,\
          \ but good practice, to <strong>'pause instance'</strong> from the '<strong>Actions</strong>'\
          \ drop down list.</li>\n<li>Click '<strong>Create Snapshot</strong>' from\
          \ the 'Actions' drop down list.</li>\n<li>Enter a descriptive name for the\
          \ Snapshot</li>\n<li>It will now take some time to create the Snapshot.\
          \ </li>\n<li>The snapshotted image will be saved in the '<strong>Project</strong>'\
          \ tab of the '<strong>Images</strong>' section.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Launching\
          \ an Instance from a saved Image</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>On the <a href=\"https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au\"\
          >NeCTAR Dashboard</a>, navigate to <strong>'Images'</strong>\n</li>\n<li>Choose\
          \ the <strong>'Project'</strong> tab</li>\n<li>Click <strong>'Launch'</strong>\
          \ in the <strong>'Actions'</strong> list for the image you wish to restore.</li>\n\
          <li>You can choose a different <strong>'Flavour'</strong> (i.e. size) of\
          \ instance, but it must be large \n enough to fit the image on the primary\
          \ 'root' disk.</li>\n<li>Name the instance, set the keypair and security\
          \ groups in the <strong>'Access and Security'</strong> tab,\n and set the\
          \ <strong>'Availability Zone'</strong> if necessary (e.g. to ensure the\
          \ same zone as your volume storage).</li>\n<li>This is just like launching\
          \ a new instance, except that the new VM will already have the settings,\n\
          \ configurations and installations of the original VM.</li>\n<li>Access\
          \ as per usual, with SSH keys and the IP address of the new instance.</li>\n\
          </ul>\n<p>NOTE: The new VM will have a new, empty <strong>secondary 'ephemeral'\
          \ storage</strong> disk. This will\nneed to be made writable with the command:<br>\n\
          <code>sudo chown ubuntu /mnt</code></p>\n<p>If required, existing <strong>volume\
          \ storage</strong> will need to be attached, mounted and made writable also.\
          \ <br>\nAttach on the <a href=\"https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au\">NeCTAR\
          \ Dashboard</a> -&gt; <strong>Volumes</strong> -&gt; <strong>Edit Attachments</strong><br>\n\
          Then access the VM command line and enter:<br>\n<code>sudo mkdir /volume_name</code><br>\n\
          <code>sudo mount /dev/vdc /volume_name -t auto</code><br>\n<code>sudo chown\
          \ ubuntu /volume_name</code></p>\n<hr>\n<p><a name=\"Volume\"></a></p>\n\
          <h2>Snapshots of Volume Storage</h2>\n<p>Snapshots can also be made to copy\
          \ the disk state of your Volume block storage.\nThis is useful for preserving\
          \ the state of your Volume in an image, in order to \ncreate a new Volume\
          \ from it at a later time. The volume snapshots use up your volume\ndata\
          \ allocation, for the full size of the volume. Volume snapshots are not\
          \ designed as a method of\nbacking up data - <a href=\"#Backup\">see data\
          \ backup suggestions later in this article</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>On the <a\
          \ href=\"https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au\">NeCTAR Dashboard</a>, navigate\
          \ to <strong>'Volumes'</strong>\n</li>\n<li>The volume should be unnattached\
          \ from an instance: Click '<strong>Edit Attachments</strong>'\n in the <strong>'Actions'</strong>\
          \ list, then '<strong>Detach Volume</strong>'.</li>\n<li>Click '<strong>Create\
          \ Snapshot</strong>' in the <strong>'Actions'</strong> list.</li>\n<li>\n\
          <p>The snapshot is found in the '<strong>Volume Snapshots</strong>' tab.</p>\n\
          </li>\n<li>\n<p>In the '<strong>Actions</strong>' drop down list, you can\
          \ <strong>create a new volume</strong> from the snapshot,\n edit the name,\
          \ or delete the snapshot when it is no longer needed (to recover the volume\
          \ storage space it uses).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2>Backing Up your Data\
          \ <a name=\"Backup\"></a>\n</h2>\n<p>As discussed earlier in this article,\
          \ Instance snapshots don't copy the larger disks\nthat are used for data\
          \ storage, and Volume snapshots are inefficient as a data back-up strategy.</p>\n\
          <p>The <strong>source</strong> for the back-up will be the secondary 'ephemeral'\
          \ storage disk, or\nfrom volume block storage.</p>\n<p>The <strong>destination</strong>\
          \ for the back-up may be your local computer, or a data storage \nserver\
          \ at your research organisation.</p>\n<h3>Compressed File Transfers</h3>\n\
          <p>The simplest back-up is to compress a directory and transfer it from\
          \ your VM to your back-up destination.</p>\n<p>The general comand structure\
          \ to compress files:<br>\n<code>tar -cvpzf &lt;NameOfArchive&gt;.tar.gz\
          \ &lt;list of your files or folders&gt;</code></p>\n<p>To copy a directory\
          \ ( /mnt/data ) into a single, compressed file ( data.tar.gz ): </p>\n<p><code>tar\
          \ -cvpzf data.tar.gz /mnt/data</code></p>\n<p>The compressed file can be\
          \ transferred to another computer using FileZilla (for a local\ncomputer\
          \ back-up), or SCP to back-up on a remote server (see the Cloud Basics article:\
          \ Transferring Data)</p>\n<p><code>scp &lt;Path_To_Source_File&gt; &lt;Path_to_Destination&gt;</code>\
          \  </p>\n<p>e.g. <code>scp ~/data.tar.gz username@remote.host.edu.au:data/directory</code><br>\n\
          or, <code>scp -i path/to/key ~/data.tar.gz username@remote.host.edu.au:data/directory</code>\
          \ </p>\n<h3>Backing up with RSYNC</h3>\n<p>This is a utility that creates\
          \ incremental backups, such that the most recent synced state \nof a source\
          \ directory is 'mirrored' in a directory on the destination storage device.</p>\n\
          <p>Syncing is a more efficient way of backing up data, as after the first\
          \ sync, only modifications to the files will be transferred.</p>\n<ul>\n\
          <li>RSYNC must be installed on the source computer (the VM) and the destination\
          \ computer.</li>\n<li>RSYNC is pre-installed on MacOSX</li>\n<li>On Ubuntu,\
          \ enter <code>sudo apt-get install rsync</code>\n</li>\n<li>On Windows,\
          \ installation is through the <a href=\"https://www.cygwin.com/\">Cygwin\
          \ package</a> and usage is more complicated.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The general\
          \ command for creating or syncing the back-up:  </p>\n<p><code>rsync -av\
          \ &lt;source directory&gt; &lt;destination directory&gt;</code><br>\nor,<br>\n\
          <code>rsync -av -e -i &lt;path-to-private-key&gt; &lt;source directory&gt;\
          \ &lt;destination directory&gt;</code></p>\n<p>To sync from the Terminal\
          \ app. on your local computer, from the directory you are syncing into:</p>\n\
          <p><code>rsync -av ubuntu@NNN.NNN.NNN.NNN:/mnt/data/ dataCopy/</code>  (this\
          \ syncs data from the VM)<br>\n<code>rsync -av dataCopy/ ubuntu@NNN.NNN.NNN.NNN:/mnt/data/</code>\
          \ (this will restore data to the VM)</p>\n<p>To sync from the VM command\
          \ line to a remote server:<br>\n<code>rsync -av /mnt/data/ username@remote.host.edu.au:data/directory/</code>\
          \  </p>\n<p>and to restore: <br>\n<code>rsync -av username@remote.host.edu.au:data/directory/\
          \ /mnt/data/</code>  </p>\n<h3>Backing up Volumes to the Object Storage</h3>\n\
          <p>This can be done with OpenStack commands. See <a href=\"http://training.nectar.org.au/package10/sections/managingVolumes.html\"\

          \ or directories, etc. \n \n \n \n \n SCP: secure copy \n \n SCP is a simple\
          \ method for transferring files between computers.  \n The basic command\
          \ for Secure Copy is like a UNIX cp, but adding a connection to a different\
          \ computer in the file path \n scp <Path_To_Source_File> <Path_to_Destination>\
          \ \n Between a local Mac/Linux and the VM \n Enter the command from your\
          \ local computer's Terminal app.  \n To upload a file to the VM: \n scp\
          \ -i ~/.ssh/Nectar_Key <local-file-path> ubuntu@NNN.NNN.NNN.NNN:<instance-file-path>\
          \ \n To download a file from your VM: \n scp -i ~/.ssh/Nectar_Key ubuntu@NNN.NNN.NNN.NNN:<instance-file-path>\
          \ <local-file-path> \n Between your VM and a data storage server \n If you\
          \ have data stored on a remote server, you can transfer files between it\
          \ and the VM through the command-line on the VM. \n You will need a host\
          \ address for the data storage server, and your username, plus usually a\
          \ password. \n scp username@host.address.edu.au:/data/myDirectory/file.txt\
          \ /mnt/data/ \nscp /mnt/data/results.zip username@host.address.edu.au:/data/myDirectory/\
          \ \n You will usually then be prompted to enter the password for your data\
          \ storage. \n n.b. use scp -i path/to/key ... if your remote server has\
          \ ssh keys rather than password access. \n \n SFTP via the Command Line\
          \ \n \n Secure file transfer is also available between the VM and remote\
          \ data storage. \n Enter the 'sftp' command on your VM, and you will have\
          \ access to the remote host. \n sftp username@host.address.edu.au   - you\
          \ will usually be prompted for a password. \n or \n sftp -i path/to/key\
          \ username@host.address.edu.au  - if the remote server has ssh key authentication\
          \ \n You are now accessing the remote data storage server, and you can navigate\
          \ the files on the server\nas per usual with commands like cd and ls. \n\
          \ The commands get and put will transfer data between the machines: \n get\
          \ <remote_server_file.txt> </mnt/localVM_destination/> \n put </mnt/localVM_destination/file.txt>\
          \ <remote_directory/> \n to close the sftp connection, type exit. "

          \ of using the commands \n \n Two major features of Cloud Computing are:\
          \  \n \n Keeping long-running memory/CPU intensive processes running on\
          \ a dedicated server; and   \n The flexibility to launch a VM with a large\
          \ number of CPU (processors) to run \n  some processes more efficiently.\
          \ \n \n There are a few UNIX tricks that can help you use these features\
          \ effectively. \n Keeping jobs running  \n \n How to close your terminal/SSH\
          \ session, while keeping your processes running on the VM \n Generally,\
          \ your instance is kept running for long periods. Unlike your local computer,\
          \ \nthe VM's do not automatically go to sleep when there hasn't been input.\
          \  They are ideal for running \nlarge jobs that may take a long time to\
          \ complete. \n When running a process from the command-line in Terminal,\
          \ the default action is\nfor the job to be attached to the terminal session,\
          \ and to terminate if the terminal session ends.\nThis means that the jobs\
          \ will be terminated if your local computer goes to sleep, or drops the\
          \ SSH connection to the VM. \n There are two main methods to keep jobs processing\
          \ on the VM without the need to keep the \nSSH terminal session running\
          \ on your local computer. \n \n Detaching a job from the terminal session\
          \ ( nohup and disown ) \n Keeping a virtual terminal session running ( GNU\
          \ Screen ) \n \n 1. Detaching a job from the terminal  \n \n Background\
          \ and foreground jobs \n Usually we run processes in the foreground:  \n\
          \ \n Our terminal window is busy until the process is finished,  \n Standard\
          \ output and error messages are printed to the terminal window  \n If we\
          \ close the terminal window, the process will terminate. \n \n We can instruct\
          \ terminal to run processes in the background ( & ): \n \n The terminal\
          \ window is not involved in the process, it is available for other commands\
          \ \n The standard output and standard error are still printed to the window\
          \ \n If we close the window, the process will still terminate  \n just put\
          \ a space and \"&\" at the end of your usual command \n  e.g. sleep 20 -\
          \ the terminal window will be unresponsive for 20 seconds \nsleep 20 & -\
          \ sleep command executes in the background, and the window remains responsive\
          \ \n \n Nohup with background \n The command nohup ensures the command does\
          \ not receive a 'hang-up' signal \nwhen the terminal session ends. \n Using\
          \ nohup combined with background: \n \n The terminal window is available\
          \ for other commands \n Standard output is printed to file ('nohup.out')\
          \  \n Closing the terminal session will not terminate the process (nohup\
          \ = no hang-up) \n Modify commands as follows:   \n \n nohup <normal commands\
          \ go here> 2>&1 & \n nohup detaches the command from the terminal session\
          \ \n2>&1 sends the standard error and the standard output to the log file\
          \ 'nohup.out'. \n  You can enter 2> /dev/null < /dev/null instead to discard\
          \ standard error messages.\n& at the end send the process to the background.\
          \ \n Nohup in foreground \n The 'nohup' command can be used without running\
          \ the job in the background by omitting the '&' at the end.\nThis is useful\
          \ when you need to provide input after entering a command (such as a password).\
          \ \n To move any process to the background, pause the job with 'control'\
          \ + 'Z', then enter bg \n \n \nnohup <commands that start a job> 2>&1  \
          \ \n Enter any input at prompts (e.g. password, input parameters for a program)\
          \   \n 'control' + 'Z'  -  to pause the job   \n \nbg   \n check the job\
          \ is running with jobs or ps or top\n \n \n There is a detailed example\
          \ of this process at the end of this article  \n Disown: detaching a job\
          \ after it has started \n If you didn't  enter nohup at the beginning of\
          \ a command, but you want to ensure it keeps running when your SSH \nsession\
          \ ends, there is a command to detach an active job called disown. The job\
          \ needs to be paused with\n'control' + 'Z' before entering the command disown.\
          \ \n \n \n<command that starts a job>   \n 'control' + 'Z'  -  to pause\
          \ the job   \n \nbg   \n \ndisown   \n Check that the process is running\
          \ with ps or top\n \n \n There is a detailed example at the end of this\
          \ article \n \n 2. Keeping the terminal session running with Byobu / GNU\
          \ Screen \n \n There are a couple of utilties that provide a 'virtual terminal'\
          \ that will keep running \non the server without the user having the terminal\
          \ application open and actively\nengaged in SSH connection with the VM.\
          \ These utilities are GNU Screen and TMUX, and this article \nwill cover\
          \ using Screen with the front-end package Byobu. \n \n It keeps your terminal\
          \ session running perpetually, you can reconnect at any time  \n This includes\
          \ keeping active any running processes attached to the terminal session\
          \ \n It will preserve processes in the foreground, or in the background\
          \ \n The next time you log in, the terminal session will be preserved as\
          \ you left it \n It is a good idea to use it with nohup commands for extra\
          \ insurance \n \n Some VM users prefer not to use a virtual terminal utility\
          \ beacause: \n \n Learning curve : Byobu/Screen has its own set of commands\
          \ to familiarise yourself with. \n Running a virtual terminal is more memory\
          \ intensive than simply using nohup or disown\n \n \n To install and set-up:\
          \ \n \n \nsudo apt-get install screen byobu   \n byobu-select-backend screen\
          \ \n \n To start a session (and name it):  \nbyobu -S JoeyStructure  \n\
          \ (The first time you use it, enter 'control' + 'a' and select 'Screen commands')\
          \ \n When you've finished your terminal session, close the window or 'ctrl'\
          \ + 'a' then 'd'.\nTo log back into the session, just type byobu and select\
          \ your session from the list. \n 'control' + 'a' (^a) is used to access\
          \ the Screens commands during a Byobu session \n\n\n\nCommand\nAction\n\n\
          \n\n\n^a then 'd'\ndetach from the byobu session, you can resume it later\n\
          \n\n^a then '?'\nhelp (menu of commands)\n\n\n^a then 'c'\nopen a new tab\n\
          \n\n^a then 'n' or 'p'\nswitch to next/previous tab\n\n\n^a then 'k'\nkill\
          \ the current tab\n\n\n^a then 'A'\ngive the tab a title\n\n\n^a then '\\\
          '\nterminates the byobu session, permanently\n\n\nexit\nterminates the byobu\
          \ session, permanently\n\n\n\n Some other features in Byobu/Screen: \n \n\
          \ Easily swap between tabs of terminal windows in your session \n Save a\
          \ log file of activity from a terminal window (^a then H) \n Split screen\
          \ - multiple terminal shells in one window (^a then S) \n [and many more][https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Byobu]\
          \  \n \n \n Spreading jobs over multiple CPUs  \n \n A major advantage of\
          \ NeCTAR cloud computing, is the power to launch VM's with multiple \nprocessors\
          \ (CPUs), depending upon your allocation.\nMultiple CPUs can efficiently\
          \ process more jobs simultaneously. GNU parallel is a \ncommand-line utility\
          \ to manage the distribution of a list of jobs to the available \nCPU cores.\
          \ \n GNU Parallel \n The GNU parallel utility will allow the user to simultaneously\
          \ run as many processes as there are CPUs.    \n If there are 32 jobs to\
          \ do and 4 CPUs, parallel will send the first 4 to be done, \nand as each\
          \ job finishes a new one will commence. \n \n To install : sudo apt-get\
          \ install parallel \n Usage: enter 'parallel' with either a list of commands,\
          \ or a list of items to be\nused as input for a given command. \n Example\
          \ Commands with Parallel \n \n Using parallel to decompress all files ending\
          \ in .gz (these two commands are identical):   \n \nparallel gunzip :::\
          \ *.gz   \n \n ls -1 *.gz | parallel gunzip \n \n \n The input data can\
          \ be saved in a text file e.g. to download files from a list of URLs (these\
          \ two commands are identical):   \n \n parallel wget < list_of_URLs.txt\
          \ \n \n parallel -a list_of_URLs.txt wget \n \n \n The text file can contain\
          \ a list of commands, each line as it would be entered in the terminal:\
          \   \n \n \n parallel < list_of_commands.txt \n \n \n By default, parallel\
          \ uses all cores in the machine.   \n \n You can dictate how many cores\
          \ to use with parallel -j # (# is the required number of cores)       \n\
          \ \n parallel -j -1 uses all CPUs except one, which leaves a CPU available\
          \ for other tasks/users. \n \n \n NOTE: Don't run parallel programs in the\
          \ background, or they will all run at once.    \n \n The nohup command works\
          \ with parallel. e.g.:   \n \n nohup parallel < list_of_commands.txt 2>&1\
          \ \n \n \n If you want to see all the processes running in parallel, htop\
          \ is an excellent system monitor.   \n \n \nsudo apt-get install htop  \
          \ \n htop \n \n \n Appendix - more details and examples from this article\

          \ table \n \n example of moving a nohup command to the background  \n \n\
          \ An example would be downloading a large file from a password-protected\
          \ remote data storage server using scp. \n \n e.g. nohup scp username@host.address.edu.au:/data/files.tar.gz\
          \ /mnt/data/ 2>&1  \n Password is entered at the prompt \n Now the download\
          \ begins. There will be no prompt in the terminal, as it is busy\n  with\
          \ the foreground process. \n Press 'control' and 'Z' to pause the download.\
          \   \n There will be output like [1]+  Stopped    nohup scp ...\n \n Enter\
          \ bg to move the process to the background  \n You will see output like\
          \ [1]+ nohup scp ...... &\n \n The download will now resume in the background.\
          \ \n Use the command jobs to see that the download job is still active.\
          \ \n \n The terminal session can be terminated, and the download job will\
          \ continue on the VM. \n \n If the job is not active (this may show as [1]-\
          \ ....): \n  check for an error message in the output file :  less nohup.out\
          \  \n \n \n example of using 'disown' \n \n If you started a large download,\
          \ and wanted it to continue without keeping the SSH\nconnection with the\
          \ VM: \n \n e.g. scp username@host.address.edu.au:/data/files.tar.gz /mnt/data/\
          \ \n Password is entered at the prompt \n Now the download begins. The standard\
          \ output will appear in the terminal. \n Press 'control' and 'Z' to pause\

          \ background</h3>\n<p>The command <strong><code>nohup</code></strong> ensures\
          \ the command does not receive a 'hang-up' signal \nwhen the terminal session\
          \ ends.</p>\n<p>Using <strong><em>nohup</em></strong> combined with background:</p>\n\
          <ul>\n<li>The terminal window is available for other commands</li>\n<li>Standard\
          \ output is printed to file ('nohup.out') </li>\n<li>Closing the terminal\
          \ session will not terminate the process (nohup = no hang-up)</li>\n<li>Modify\
          \ commands as follows:  </li>\n</ul>\n<p><code>nohup &lt;normal commands\
          \ go here&gt; 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;</code></p>\n<p><strong><code>nohup</code></strong>\
          \ detaches the command from the terminal session \n<strong><code>2&gt;&amp;1</code></strong>\
          \ sends the standard error and the standard output to the log file 'nohup.out'.<br>\n\
          \  You can enter <code>2&gt; /dev/null &lt; /dev/null</code> instead to\
          \ discard standard error messages.\n<strong><code>&amp;</code></strong>\
          \ at the end send the process to the background.</p>\n<h3>Nohup in foreground</h3>\n\
          <p>The 'nohup' command can be used without running the job in the background\
          \ by omitting the '<code>&amp;</code>' at the end.\nThis is useful when\
          \ you need to provide input after entering a command (such as a password).</p>\n\
          <p>To move any process to the background, pause the job with <strong>'control'\
          \ + 'Z'</strong>, then enter <strong><code>bg</code></strong></p>\n<ul>\n\
          <li>\n<code>nohup &lt;commands that start a job&gt; 2&gt;&amp;1</code> \
          \ </li>\n<li>Enter any input at prompts (e.g. password, input parameters\
          \ for a program)  </li>\n<li>'control' + 'Z'  -  to pause the job  </li>\n\
          <li>\n<code>bg</code>  </li>\n<li>check the job is running with <code>jobs</code>\
          \ or <code>ps</code> or <code>top</code>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There is a detailed\
          \ example of this process <a href=\"#egnohup\">at the end of this article</a>\
          \ </p>\n<h3>Disown: detaching a job after it has started</h3>\n<p>If you\
          \ didn't  enter <code>nohup</code> at the beginning of a command, but you\
          \ want to ensure it keeps running when your SSH \nsession ends, there is\
          \ a command to detach an active job called <strong><code>disown</code></strong>.\
          \ The job needs to be paused with\n'control' + 'Z' before entering the command\
          \ <code>disown</code>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<code>&lt;command that starts a\
          \ job&gt;</code>  </li>\n<li>'control' + 'Z'  -  to pause the job  </li>\n\
          <li>\n<code>bg</code>  </li>\n<li>\n<code>disown</code>  </li>\n<li>Check\

          \ running with Byobu / GNU Screen <a name=\"screen\"></a>\n</h2>\n<p>There\
          \ are a couple of utilties that provide a 'virtual terminal' that will keep\
          \ running \non the server without the user having the terminal application\
          \ open and actively\nengaged in SSH connection with the VM. These utilities\
          \ are GNU Screen and TMUX, and this article \nwill cover using Screen with\
          \ the front-end package Byobu.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It keeps your terminal session\
          \ running perpetually, you can reconnect at any time </li>\n<li>This includes\
          \ keeping active any running processes attached to the terminal session</li>\n\
          <li>It will preserve processes in the foreground, or in the background</li>\n\
          <li>The next time you log in, the terminal session will be preserved as\
          \ you left it</li>\n<li>It is a good idea to use it with <code>nohup</code>\
          \ commands for extra insurance</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some VM users prefer not\
          \ to use a virtual terminal utility beacause:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Learning curve\
          \ : Byobu/Screen has its own set of <a href=\"#byobu\">commands</a> to familiarise\
          \ yourself with.</li>\n<li>Running a virtual terminal is more memory intensive\
          \ than simply using <code>nohup</code> or <code>disown</code>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\
          <p>To install and set-up:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<code>sudo apt-get install screen\

          </ul>\n<p>To start a session (and name it): <br>\n<code>byobu -S JoeyStructure</code>\
          \ </p>\n<p>(The first time you use it, enter 'control' + 'a' and select\
          \ 'Screen commands')</p>\n<p>When you've finished your terminal session,\
          \ close the window or 'ctrl' + 'a' then 'd'.\nTo log back into the session,\
          \ just type <code>byobu</code> and select your session from the list.</p>\n\

          \ is the power to launch VM's with multiple \nprocessors (CPUs), depending\
          \ upon your allocation.\nMultiple CPUs can efficiently process more jobs\
          \ simultaneously. GNU parallel is a \ncommand-line utility to manage the\
          \ distribution of a list of jobs to the available \nCPU cores.</p>\n<h3>GNU\
          \ Parallel</h3>\n<p>The GNU parallel utility will allow the user to simultaneously\
          \ run as many processes as there are CPUs.   </p>\n<p>If there are 32 jobs\
          \ to do and 4 CPUs, parallel will send the first 4 to be done, \nand as\
          \ each job finishes a new one will commence.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"\

          ></p>\n<p>To install : <code>sudo apt-get install parallel</code></p>\n\
          <p>Usage: enter 'parallel' with either a list of commands, or a list of\
          \ items to be\nused as input for a given command.</p>\n<h4>Example Commands\
          \ with Parallel</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Using parallel to decompress all files ending\
          \ in .gz (these two commands are identical):  </li>\n<li>\n<code>parallel\
          \ gunzip ::: *.gz</code>  </li>\n<li>\n<p><code>ls -1 *.gz | parallel gunzip</code></p>\n\
          </li>\n<li>\n<p>The input data can be saved in a text file e.g. to download\
          \ files from a list of URLs (these two commands are identical):  </p>\n\
          </li>\n<li><code>parallel wget &lt; list_of_URLs.txt</code></li>\n<li>\n\
          <p><code>parallel -a list_of_URLs.txt wget</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The\
          \ text file can contain a list of commands, each line as it would be entered\
          \ in the terminal:  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>parallel &lt; list_of_commands.txt</code></p>\n\
          </li>\n<li>\n<p>By default, parallel uses all cores in the machine.  </p>\n\
          </li>\n<li>You can dictate how many cores to use with <code>parallel -j\
          \ #</code> (# is the required number of cores)      </li>\n<li>\n<p><code>parallel\
          \ -j -1</code> uses all CPUs except one, which leaves a CPU available for\
          \ other tasks/users.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Don't run\
          \ parallel programs in the background, or they will all run at once.   </p>\n\
          </li>\n<li>The <strong>nohup</strong> command works with parallel. e.g.:\
          \  </li>\n<li>\n<p><code>nohup parallel &lt; list_of_commands.txt 2&gt;&amp;1</code></p>\n\
          </li>\n<li>\n<p>If you want to see all the processes running in parallel,\
          \ htop is an excellent system monitor.  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<code>sudo apt-get\

    <p>Two major features of Cloud Computing are: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Keeping long-running\
    \ memory/CPU intensive processes running on a dedicated server; and  </li>\n<li>The\
    \ flexibility to launch a VM with a large number of CPU (processors) to run \n\
    \  some processes more efficiently.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There are a few UNIX tricks\
    \ that can help you use these features effectively.</p>\n<h2>Keeping jobs running\
    \  <a name=\"running\"></a></h2>\n<h3>How to close your terminal/SSH session,\
    \ while keeping your processes running on the VM</h3>\n<p>Generally, your instance\
    \ is kept running for long periods. Unlike your local computer, \nthe VM's do\
    \ not automatically go to sleep when there hasn't been input.  They are ideal\
    \ for running \nlarge jobs that may take a long time to complete.</p>\n<p>When\
    \ running a process from the command-line in Terminal, the default action is\n\
    for the job to be attached to the terminal session, and to terminate if the terminal\
    \ session ends.\nThis means that the jobs will be terminated if your local computer\
    \ goes to sleep, or drops the SSH connection to the VM.</p>\n<p>There are two\
    \ main methods to keep jobs processing on the VM without the need to keep the\
    \ \nSSH terminal session running on your local computer.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Detaching\
    \ a job from the terminal session ( <code>nohup</code> and <code>disown</code>\
    \ )</li>\n<li>Keeping a virtual terminal session running ( GNU Screen )</li>\n\
    </ol>\n<h2>1. Detaching a job from the terminal  <a name=\"nohup\"></a></h2>\n\
    <h3>Background and foreground jobs</h3>\n<p>Usually we run processes in the <strong><em>foreground</em></strong>:\
    \ </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Our terminal window is busy until the process is finished, </li>\n\
    <li>Standard output and error messages are printed to the terminal window </li>\n\
    <li>If we close the terminal window, the process will terminate.</li>\n</ul>\n\
    <p>We can instruct terminal to run processes in the <strong><em>background</em></strong>\
    \ <strong>( <code>&amp;</code> )</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The terminal window\
    \ is not involved in the process, it is available for other commands</li>\n<li>The\
    \ standard output and standard error are still printed to the window</li>\n<li>If\
    \ we close the window, the process will still terminate </li>\n<li>just put a\
    \ space and \"&amp;\" at the end of your usual command<br>\n  e.g. <code>sleep\
    \ 20</code> - the terminal window will be unresponsive for 20 seconds<br>\n<code>sleep\
    \ 20 &amp;</code> - sleep command executes in the background, and the window remains\
    \ responsive</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Nohup with background</h3>\n<p>The command <strong><code>nohup</code></strong>\
    \ ensures the command does not receive a 'hang-up' signal \nwhen the terminal\
    \ session ends.</p>\n<p>Using <strong><em>nohup</em></strong> combined with background:</p>\n\
    <ul>\n<li>The terminal window is available for other commands</li>\n<li>Standard\
    \ output is printed to file ('nohup.out') </li>\n<li>Closing the terminal session\
    \ will not terminate the process (nohup = no hang-up)</li>\n<li>Modify commands\
    \ as follows:  </li>\n</ul>\n<p><code>nohup &lt;normal commands go here&gt; 2&gt;&amp;1\
    \ &amp;</code></p>\n<p><strong><code>nohup</code></strong> detaches the command\
    \ from the terminal session \n<strong><code>2&gt;&amp;1</code></strong> sends\
    \ the standard error and the standard output to the log file 'nohup.out'.<br>\n\
    \  You can enter <code>2&gt; /dev/null &lt; /dev/null</code> instead to discard\
    \ standard error messages.\n<strong><code>&amp;</code></strong> at the end send\
    \ the process to the background.</p>\n<h3>Nohup in foreground</h3>\n<p>The 'nohup'\
    \ command can be used without running the job in the background by omitting the\
    \ '<code>&amp;</code>' at the end.\nThis is useful when you need to provide input\
    \ after entering a command (such as a password).</p>\n<p>To move any process to\
    \ the background, pause the job with <strong>'control' + 'Z'</strong>, then enter\
    \ <strong><code>bg</code></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>nohup &lt;commands that\
    \ start a job&gt; 2&gt;&amp;1</code>  </li>\n<li>Enter any input at prompts (e.g.\
    \ password, input parameters for a program)  </li>\n<li>'control' + 'Z'  -  to\
    \ pause the job  </li>\n<li><code>bg</code>  </li>\n<li>check the job is running\
    \ with <code>jobs</code> or <code>ps</code> or <code>top</code></li>\n</ul>\n\
    <p>There is a detailed example of this process <a href=\"#egnohup\">at the end\
    \ of this article</a> </p>\n<h3>Disown: detaching a job after it has started</h3>\n\
    <p>If you didn't  enter <code>nohup</code> at the beginning of a command, but\
    \ you want to ensure it keeps running when your SSH \nsession ends, there is a\
    \ command to detach an active job called <strong><code>disown</code></strong>.\
    \ The job needs to be paused with\n'control' + 'Z' before entering the command\
    \ <code>disown</code>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>&lt;command that starts a job&gt;</code>\
    \  </li>\n<li>'control' + 'Z'  -  to pause the job  </li>\n<li><code>bg</code>\
    \  </li>\n<li><code>disown</code>  </li>\n<li>Check that the process is running\
    \ with <code>ps</code> or <code>top</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>There is a detailed\
    \ example at the <a href=\"#disown\">end of this article</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h2>2.\
    \ Keeping the terminal session running with Byobu / GNU Screen <a name=\"screen\"\
    ></a></h2>\n<p>There are a couple of utilties that provide a 'virtual terminal'\
    \ that will keep running \non the server without the user having the terminal\
    \ application open and actively\nengaged in SSH connection with the VM. These\
    \ utilities are GNU Screen and TMUX, and this article \nwill cover using Screen\
    \ with the front-end package Byobu.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It keeps your terminal session\
    \ running perpetually, you can reconnect at any time </li>\n<li>This includes\
    \ keeping active any running processes attached to the terminal session</li>\n\
    <li>It will preserve processes in the foreground, or in the background</li>\n\
    <li>The next time you log in, the terminal session will be preserved as you left\
    \ it</li>\n<li>It is a good idea to use it with <code>nohup</code> commands for\
    \ extra insurance</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some VM users prefer not to use a virtual terminal\
    \ utility beacause:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Learning curve : Byobu/Screen has its own set\
    \ of <a href=\"#byobu\">commands</a> to familiarise yourself with.</li>\n<li>Running\
    \ a virtual terminal is more memory intensive than simply using <code>nohup</code>\

    \ apt-get install screen byobu</code>  </li>\n<li><code>byobu-select-backend screen</code></li>\n\
    </ul>\n<p>To start a session (and name it): <br>\n<code>byobu -S JoeyStructure</code>\
    \ </p>\n<p>(The first time you use it, enter 'control' + 'a' and select 'Screen\
    \ commands')</p>\n<p>When you've finished your terminal session, close the window\

    ></a></h2>\n<p>A major advantage of NeCTAR cloud computing, is the power to launch\
    \ VM's with multiple \nprocessors (CPUs), depending upon your allocation.\nMultiple\
    \ CPUs can efficiently process more jobs simultaneously. GNU parallel is a \n\
    command-line utility to manage the distribution of a list of jobs to the available\
    \ \nCPU cores.</p>\n<h3>GNU Parallel</h3>\n<p>The GNU parallel utility will allow\
    \ the user to simultaneously run as many processes as there are CPUs.   </p>\n\
    <p>If there are 32 jobs to do and 4 CPUs, parallel will send the first 4 to be\
    \ done, \nand as each job finishes a new one will commence.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\

    ></p>\n<p>To install : <code>sudo apt-get install parallel</code></p>\n<p>Usage:\
    \ enter 'parallel' with either a list of commands, or a list of items to be\n\
    used as input for a given command.</p>\n<h4>Example Commands with Parallel</h4>\n\
    <ul>\n<li>Using parallel to decompress all files ending in .gz (these two commands\
    \ are identical):  </li>\n<li><code>parallel gunzip ::: *.gz</code>  </li>\n<li>\n\
    <p><code>ls -1 *.gz | parallel gunzip</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The input data\
    \ can be saved in a text file e.g. to download files from a list of URLs (these\
    \ two commands are identical):  </p>\n</li>\n<li><code>parallel wget &lt; list_of_URLs.txt</code></li>\n\
    <li>\n<p><code>parallel -a list_of_URLs.txt wget</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The\
    \ text file can contain a list of commands, each line as it would be entered in\
    \ the terminal:  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>parallel &lt; list_of_commands.txt</code></p>\n\
    </li>\n<li>\n<p>By default, parallel uses all cores in the machine.  </p>\n</li>\n\
    <li>You can dictate how many cores to use with <code>parallel -j #</code> (# is\
    \ the required number of cores)      </li>\n<li>\n<p><code>parallel -j -1</code>\
    \ uses all CPUs except one, which leaves a CPU available for other tasks/users.</p>\n\
    </li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Don't run parallel programs in the background,\
    \ or they will all run at once.   </p>\n</li>\n<li>The <strong>nohup</strong>\
    \ command works with parallel. e.g.:  </li>\n<li>\n<p><code>nohup parallel &lt;\
    \ list_of_commands.txt 2&gt;&amp;1</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you want to\
    \ see all the processes running in parallel, htop is an excellent system monitor.\

          \ is aiming to support South Australian users running \nWindows applications\
          \ in the NeCTAR Australian research cloud. We are currently trialling an\
          \ \napproach where users can access Windows virtual machines (VMs) in the\
          \ cloud using Remote Desktop. \n This is currently a pilot service which\
          \ uses short-term Windows trial licenses, but eRSA will be providing a production\
          \ service through a Microsoft Service Provider License Agreement (SPLA)\
          \ in early 2016. \n eRSA staff will need to set up your Windows VM image\
          \ for the cloud. Once the image \nis created, you can set up a Windows virtual\
          \ machine in the cloud by following the \nsteps specified below, or eRSA\
          \ staff can do it for you. Email eRSA Helpdesk \nand we will assist you\
          \ with getting started using Windows in the cloud. \n This service is designed\
          \ for: \n \n Researchers using software that is only available on Windows.\
          \ \n Researchers that are more comfortable using the familiar environment\
          \ of the windows\n  desktop for their cloud computing. \n \n Glossary of\
          \ Terms  \nTop of page \n \n \n Cloud allocation and Windows image \n The\
          \ Windows operating system is much larger than the standard Linux operating\
          \ systems that are usually used on NeCTAR VMs. \nYou will need to run the\
          \ Windows image on an 'm2' Instance type, which has a 30GB root\ndrive rather\
          \ than 10 GB. You will need to request a NeCTAR allocation beyond the standard\
          \ personal project\nresource. By requesting more 'cores', you can launch\
          \ instances that have enough storage to \ncope with the Windows operating\
          \ system as well as storing and processing data. \n Log in to the web dashboard\
          \ for the cloud \nand click on New Request under Allocations in the left\
          \ hand side menu. Email the \neRSA Helpdesk if you have questions about\
          \ any of the information in the form.\nNew requests can take a couple of\
          \ weeks to process, and allocations are merit-based. \n To access an image\
          \ with the Windows operating system, under current licensing agreements,\
          \ you need to be researching in South Australia\nand be registered with\
          \ eResearchSA. Email the eRSA Helpdesk\nto request an image to access Windows\
          \ in the Cloud, and supply your NeCTAR username (the email address you use\
          \ to \nlog on to NeCTAR services) and the name of the project which has\
          \ the allocations you \nhave requested.  You will be emailed a username\
          \ and password to access the Windows VM,\nand an image with the Windows\
          \ trial will be made available on your NeCTAR Dashboard. \n Glossary of\
          \ Terms \nTop of page \n \n \n Creating a security group \n \n \n First\
          \ you will need to create a security group to allow you to connect to the\
          \ \n  virtual machine remotely with Windows remote desktop.  \n \n \n Select\
          \ \"Access & Security\" under the left hand side pane under \"Compute\"\
          . \n \n \n  Select the \"Create Security Group\" button near the top right\
          \ corner \n \n \n Give your security group a name and description and click\
          \ the \"Create Security Group\" button \n \n \n \n Click \"Manage Rules\"\
          \ in the \"Actions\" drop-down menu \n \n \n  Click on the \"Add Rule\"\
          \ button near the top right corner  \n \n \n A small window should pop up.\
          \ Make sure the \"Rule\" is set to \"Custom TCP Rule\" \n  and \"Open Port\"\
          \ is set to \"Port\". Under the Port textbox enter \"3389\". Set \"Remote\"\
          \ \n  to \"CIDR\" and under the \"CIDR\" textbox enter one of the following\
          \ IP ranges as appropriate. \n \n 129.127.0.0/16 - University of Adelaide\
          \ \n 129.96.0.0/16 - Flinders \n 130.220.0.0/16 - UniSA   \n \n \n E.g.\
          \ for a user from the University of Adelaide: \n \n \n \n By specifying\
          \ these IP ranges, your Windows VM will be more secure as it can only be\
          \ accessed by computers in the University network, or using your university\

          \ image) is a copy of the entire state of a computer system \nsaved as a\
          \ file. Images are used in two ways in NeCTAR. Firstly as a template for\
          \ \nVirtual Machines (VMs). You can launch a VM based on an image. \nThe\
          \ second use of images is to preserve the state of a VM as configured by\
          \ you as end user. \nThis type of image is usually referred to as a snapshot.\
          \ \n \n Instance \n \n An instance is a VM hosted on the NeCTAR OpenStack\
          \ infrastructure. \n \n Project \n \n The NeCTAR term for a \"resource container\"\
          ; i.e. what you get when you \nare granted a NeCTAR allocation. A project\
          \ \"owns\" virtual machine instances, snapshots \nand various kinds of storage,\
          \ and may be shared by multiple users. \n \n Security Group \n \n A set\
          \ of access rules that may be applied to one or more instances. \nAn access\
          \ rule allows network access to an instance from other hosts with a \nspecified\
          \ combination of protocol family (e.g. TCP, UDP, UCMP), port number and\
          \ address range. \n \n Virtual Machine \n \n A virtual machine (VM) is an\
          \ operating system (OS) or application environment that \nis installed on\
          \ software which imitates dedicated hardware. The end user has the same\
          \ \nexperience on a virtual machine as they would have on dedicated hardware.\
          \ \n \n Volume Storage \n \n Data Storage in your Virtual Machine that works\
          \ like a hard-drive on your PC or \nlaptop does. Volume storage is automatically\
          \ available in your VM as the storage \nspace for you system drive. Some\
          \ flavors of VMs include an amount of ephemeral volume \nstorage. Depending\
          \ on your allocation you can have persistent volume storage attached to\
          \ your VM. \n \n Full Glossary Page \nNeCTAR FAQ - general inormation \n\

          <blockquote>\n<p>An image (or system image) is a copy of the entire state\
          \ of a computer system \nsaved as a file. Images are used in two ways in\
          \ NeCTAR. Firstly as a template for \nVirtual Machines (VMs). You can launch\
          \ a VM based on an image. \nThe second use of images is to preserve the\
          \ state of a VM as configured by you as end user. \nThis type of image is\
          \ usually referred to as a snapshot.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Instance</strong></p>\n\

          \ term for a \"resource container\"; i.e. what you get when you \nare granted\

          \ set of access rules that may be applied to one or more instances. \nAn\
          \ access rule allows network access to an instance from other hosts with\
          \ a \nspecified combination of protocol family (e.g. TCP, UDP, UCMP), port\
          \ number and address range.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Virtual Machine</strong></p>\n\
          <blockquote>\n<p>A virtual machine (VM) is an operating system (OS) or application\
          \ environment that \nis installed on software which imitates dedicated hardware.\
          \ The end user has the same \nexperience on a virtual machine as they would\

          <blockquote>\n<p>Data Storage in your Virtual Machine that works like a\
          \ hard-drive on your PC or \nlaptop does. Volume storage is automatically\
          \ available in your VM as the storage \nspace for you system drive. Some\
          \ flavors of VMs include an amount of ephemeral volume \nstorage. Depending\
          \ on your allocation you can have persistent volume storage attached to\
          \ your VM.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://support.nectar.org.au/support/solutions/articles/6000055445-glossary\"\

    \ aiming to support South Australian users running \nWindows applications in the\
    \ NeCTAR Australian research cloud. We are currently trialling an \napproach where\
    \ users can access Windows virtual machines (VMs) in the cloud using Remote Desktop.</p>\n\
    <p>This is currently a pilot service which uses short-term Windows trial licenses,\
    \ but eRSA will be providing a production service through a Microsoft Service\
    \ Provider License Agreement (SPLA) in early 2016.</p>\n<p>eRSA staff will need\
    \ to set up your Windows VM image for the cloud. Once the image \nis created,\
    \ you can set up a Windows virtual machine in the cloud by following the \nsteps\
    \ specified below, or eRSA staff can do it for you. Email <a href=\"mailto:servicedesk@ersa.edu.au\"\
    >eRSA Helpdesk</a> \nand we will assist you with getting started using Windows\
    \ in the cloud.</p>\n<p>This service is designed for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Researchers\

    \ system is much larger than the standard Linux operating systems that are usually\
    \ used on NeCTAR VMs. \nYou will need to run the Windows image on an '<strong>m2</strong>'\
    \ Instance type, which has a 30GB root\ndrive rather than 10 GB. You will need\
    \ to request a <a href=\"https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au/project/request/\"\
    >NeCTAR allocation</a> beyond the standard personal project\nresource. By requesting\
    \ more 'cores', you can launch instances that have enough storage to \ncope with\
    \ the Windows operating system as well as storing and processing data.</p>\n<p>Log\
    \ in to the <a href=\"https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au/\">web dashboard</a>\
    \ for the cloud \nand click on <strong>New Request</strong> under <strong>Allocations</strong>\
    \ in the left hand side menu. Email the \n<a href=\"mailto:servicedesk@ersa.edu.au\"\
    >eRSA Helpdesk</a> if you have questions about any of the information in the form.\n\
    New requests can take a couple of weeks to process, and allocations are merit-based.</p>\n\
    <p>To access an image with the Windows operating system, under current licensing\
    \ agreements, you need to be researching in South Australia\nand be <a href=\"\
    https://register.ersa.edu.au/\">registered with eResearchSA</a>. Email the <a\
    \ href=\"mailto:servicedesk@ersa.edu.au\">eRSA Helpdesk</a>\nto request an image\
    \ to access Windows in the Cloud, and supply your NeCTAR username (the email address\
    \ you use to \nlog on to NeCTAR services) and the name of the project which has\
    \ the allocations you \nhave requested.  You will be emailed a username and password\
    \ to access the Windows VM,\nand an image with the Windows trial will be made\
    \ available on your NeCTAR Dashboard.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#glossary\">Glossary of\

        desc_un_html: " Twitter Scraper User Guide \n Description \n Twitter Scraper\
          \ is a tool developed by Intersect for use in collecting data directly from\
          \ the Twitter Stream API based on a variety of parameters, including hashtags\
          \ and phrases, users, location and language, and outputs matching tweets\
          \ to a comma separated values (.csv) spreadsheet for analysis. \n Target\
          \ Audience \n Twitter Scraper is available for use by any researcher with\
          \ an account at an Australian research institution that subscribes to the\
          \ Australian Access Federation (see the full list of AAF subscribers). Researchers\
          \ who want to incorporate data from Twitter into their research are encouraged\
          \ to use Twitter Scraper as a powerful, though relatively easy, service\
          \ which can be run on the NeCTAR Research Cloud. NeCTAR offer VMs to researchers\
          \ for free for a trial period, or longer periods under a merit allocation\
          \ scheme. Twitter Scraper itself is completely free for researchers. \n\
          \ How to Launch \n Twitter Scraper is deployed through Launchpod, a web\
          \ utility for configuring and deploying virtual machines (VMs) onto the\
          \ NeCTAR Research Cloud. Launchpod allows for users with little or no experience\
          \ with cloud computing to configure and deploy Twitter Scraper easily and\
          \ quickly. Before deploying Twitter Scraper, please refer to the documentation\
          \ for deploying VMs using Launchpod. \n If you intend to log into Twitter\
          \ Scraper via SSH, for example to modify the harvester settings after it\
          \ has been deployed, you must specify an SSH keypair in Launchpod. Please\
          \ follow the instructions in the Launchpod user guide or at NeCTAR Research\
          \ Cloud on how to do so. \n Obtaining Twitter access credentials \n Important:\
          \ The steps to obtain your Twitter access tokens and consumer API keys only\
          \ need to be done once. If you intend to deploy more Twitter Scrapers, you\
          \ should use the same access tokens and credentials. You can always log\
          \ into the Twitter Applications Development site to get access tokens you've\
          \ already generated, or you can keep them in a safe place for later use.\
          \ \n Twitter Scraper uses your Twitter account to monitor the constant stream\
          \ of tweets and find those matching your specified search terms. Before\
          \ you can use Twitter Scraper, you need to create an \u2018application\u2019\
          \ within Twitter, and then obtain the Consumer Key and the Consumer Secret\
          \ from this application, as well as your Access Token and Access Token Secret.\
          \ \n First, navigate to the Twitter Applications Development site and log\
          \ in with your Twitter credentials. From here you will create the \u2018\
          application\u2019. This page is typically used by developers to register\
          \ apps that they have created and which people can download. Most of the\
          \ information is actually irrelevant for Twitter Scraper, but it needs to\
          \ be entered in order to create the access credentials that Twitter Scraper\
          \ needs. As of mid-2015, you need to have a mobile phone number associated\
          \ with your Twitter account to register an application. If you don't have\
          \ a mobile number, go to your Twitter profile and enter one. \n Click Create\
          \ New App and provide a name (such as \u2018Twitter Scraper\u2019) and a\
          \ brief description (such as \u2018this is an app to harvest tweets\u2019\
          ). You also need to provide a URL. It does not have to be a real website,\
          \ but it does have to begin with http://. A dummy URL like http://www.example.com\
          \ is sufficient. Scroll to the end of the page and select 'Yes, I agree\
          \ to the Developer Agreement'. Finally, click 'Create your Twitter Application'.\
          \ \n Once your app has been created, navigate to the \u2018Keys and Access\
          \ Tokens\u2019 tab of the app settings. This page will display two of the\
          \ four settings you need, the Consumer Key (API Key) and the Consumer Secret\
          \ (API Secret). You can copy these straight out of Twitter and into a note\
          \ or document for use later, or put them directly into the relevant fields\
          \ in Launchpod. \n \n To generate the other two credentials, scroll to the\
          \ bottom of the same page and under 'Your Access Token' click the button\
          \ 'Create my access token'. The page will reload, and the Access Token and\
          \ the Access Token Secret will be displayed at the end. Make sure when copying\
          \ the Access Token that you copy the whole line including the 9-digit number\
          \ at the front, which is the same as your owner ID. The Launchpod Twitter\
          \ Scraper will not function without this. \n \n Now that you have all of\
          \ the access credentials needed to deploy Twitter Scraper, you can begin\
          \ configuring the tweet harvesting parameters. \n Specifying Harvest Parameters\
          \ \n Twitter Scraper search parameters need to be configured prior to the\
          \ deployment of the server. Once it is deployed, you cannot change the search\
          \ settings without logging in to the VM via SSH. Harvest parameters are\
          \ split into two categories: Matching Options, what Twitter Scraper will\
          \ search for; and Output Options, how Twitter Scraper will format and configure\
          \ the output CSV file. \n Matching options \n Phrases \n This is where you\
          \ will enter the search terms and hashtags that Twitter Scraper will monitor\
          \ the Twitter stream for. You can set search phrases in a number of ways.\
          \ To search for an individual word, enter a single word and hit return.\
          \ If you want to search for tweets that contain multiple words in any order,\
          \ enter each word and hit return. If you want to search for an exact phrase,\
          \ enclose the phrase in double quotes before hitting return. The example\
          \ below will return any tweet that contains the word \u2018Launchpod\u2019\
          , in addition to any tweet that contains both the words \u2018Intersect\u2019\
          \ and \u2018Australia\u2019, in addition to any tweet that contains the\
          \ exact phrase \u2018Twitter Scraper\u2019. \n \n In other words, each search\
          \ term is separated by an implicit OR operation, and every word inside a\
          \ search term (such as \u2018Intersect Australia\u2019 above) is separated\
          \ by an implicit AND operation. Lastly, any phrase in double quotes will\
          \ match only those tweets that contain that exact phrase. You can also mix\
          \ multiple words and exact phrases in a single search term, such as the\
          \ search term below, which will return only tweets that contain the exact\
          \ phrase \u2018Twitter Scraper\u2019 as well as both words \u2018Intersect\u2019\
          \ and \u2018Australia\u2019. \n \n Exclude Phrases \n This field is used\
          \ to block the persistence of tweets that match the pattern. Exclusion overrules\
          \ inclusion, meaning that even if a tweet matches every inclusion parameter,\
          \ if it matches a single exclusion parameter, it will not be included in\
          \ the output. The excluded phrases field works exactly like the phrases\
          \ field in the interpretation of terms. \n Users \n You may also specify\
          \ particular users you want to include in your search using the users field.\
          \ If you leave this blank, the effect will be that all users are included\
          \ in the harvest. If you have just one username entered, only tweets from\
          \ that user will be included in the output. If you need to include a large\
          \ list of usernames, you can paste a list of usernames separated by commas.\
          \ \n If you specify both a set of users and a set of phrases for your harvest\
          \ parameters, both criteria must be satisfied for a tweet to be harvested.\
          \ In otherwords, only tweets by users specified in your Users and which\
          \ satisfy your phrase search will be harvested. You may specify a set of\
          \ users, or just a single user, without specifying search phrases, in which\
          \ case all tweets by those users will be harvested. \n Location \n Checking\
          \ the \u2018Set Location Bounds\u2019 will open a map window in which you\
          \ can define a bounding box. Only tweets that are geocoded as originating\
          \ from inside that box will be included in the output. Tweets that originated\
          \ from outside the bounding box will not be harvested, nor will tweets that\
          \ are not geocoded. Remember that users can switch off geocoding, and many\
          \ do for privacy reasons. \n Languages \n You can use the Languages field\
          \ to restrict your search to tweets in that language. You can also select\
          \ multiple languages. The effect of selecting no language here is analogous\
          \ to selecting no users; any tweet will match irrespective of its language\
          \ value. Tweets are identified as being in a particular language automatically\
          \ by machine detection, and this may not work perfectly. \n Output Options\
          \ \n Output Fields \n The output fields allows you to customise the spreadsheet\
          \ output containing the tweets. By default, all elements are included, but\
          \ you can uncheck any of the checkboxes if you do not want to include a\
          \ particular tweet attribute in your output. \n Treat Hashtags Independently\
          \ \n This setting modified the behaviour of Twitter Scraper when tweets\
          \ contain multiple hashtags. Hashtags are parsed out of the content of the\
          \ tweet body and sent to a separate column of the spreadsheet output. If\
          \ this box is left unchecked, a tweet containing more than one tweet will\
          \ occur once in the spreadsheet, and both hashtags will be written to the\
          \ hashtag column. If this box is checked, then the tweet will be repeated\
          \ in the output spreadsheet, once for each hashtag, and the hashtag column\
          \ will contain only one hashtag. This may be useful if you intend to process\
          \ the output of the scraper using hashtags. If you only intend to analyse\
          \ the tweet body, you may want to leave this box unchecked so as not to\
          \ have repeats of the tweet. \n De-Identify \n This checkbox allows you\
          \ to de-identify the tweets captured by the scraper, which can be useful\
          \ for research ethics and privacy concerns. When this box is checked, the\
          \ username column of the output will be replaced by a string so that you\
          \ cannot identify the user. However, since the same username will be replaced\
          \ by the same string each time, meaning you are still able to track particular\
          \ users\u2019 tweets. Note that selecting the de-identify checkbox does\
          \ not obscure usernames within the body text of tweets. \n Period \n The\
          \ period refers to the time interval between each time Twitter Scraper writes\
          \ the data out to a spreadsheet. The output works by filling a cached buffer\
          \ of tweets as they emerge in the Twitter stream and are captured by the\
          \ scraper. The buffer can fit a few dozen tweets. When the buffer fills,\
          \ the content is appended to a spreadsheet. When the period ends and the\
          \ next period begins (that is, the next hour if you select \u2018hourly\u2019\
          ), then a new spreadsheet will be commenced. If you select \u2018none\u2019\
          \ as the period, then every matching tweet will be written to the same spreadsheet.\
          \ If your scrape settings are broad and capture a lot of tweets, the spreadsheet\
          \ can blow out in size very quickly. Depending on how many tweets you expect\
          \ to match your search settings, you may want to set the period to daily,\
          \ or even hourly, to manage the size of the output spreadsheet. \n After\
          \ you have configured Twitter Scraper, you can now deploy it by clicking\
          \ \u2018Deploy\u2019. The process should only take around three minutes,\
          \ after which you will be sent an email letting you know that your Twitter\
          \ Scraper instance has been deployed. This email will also let you know\
          \ how you can access the data. \n Accessing Data \n Twitter Scraper allows\
          \ for two methods of accessing the data that it generates: over http using\
          \ a browser, or by logging in to the VM using SSH. Access the machine via\
          \ SSH also enables you to undertake further configuration and advanced usage,\
          \ such as modifying the harvest settings, restarting the harvester or configuring\
          \ additional harvests. \n How to Access Data via Web \n While Twitter Scraper\
          \ is operational, it will continue to extract tweets from the Twitter Stream\
          \ and, every time its buffer fills, write those tweets to the csv file.\
          \ A link to the location of the spreadsheet, consisting of the IP address\
          \ of the machine and a directory, such as {IP address}/1, will be included\
          \ in the email that Launchpod sends you. Clicking this link will take you\
          \ to a web view of a directory on the VM containing a spreadsheet (or more)\
          \ of Twitter Scraper's output data. If you selected a time period, then\
          \ you will see one spreadsheet corresponding to each of that period that\
          \ has begun since the VM was deployed.  \n \n Due to the way Twitter Scraper\
          \ is deployed, there are no easy ways to see if it is working, until tweets\
          \ begin to appear in the spreadsheet, which, depending on the harvest settings,\
          \ could be a long time. That is, if you specific very specific search terms,\
          \ you might be waiting a long time for the buffer to fill and for the tweets\
          \ to be written to the spreadsheet, and in the meantime, you have no way\
          \ of knowing whether the lack of output is due to an error or a lack of\
          \ matching tweets. There is a log file which can be accessed by navigating\
          \ to the IP of the machine (sent to your email) followed by /logs. If the\
          \ scraper is working, this log file will display lines like: \n 2015-04-15\
          \ 00:05:41,925 INFO  (LoggerTweetProcessor.java:42) - [1] Processed 10 tweets\
          \ \n If the log file shows an error or java exception instead, then you\
          \ may have configured the machine incorrectly. You should delete the instance\
          \ and try again, paying particular attention to the Twitter API Access Tokens\
          \ and Consumer Keys. Alternatively, you can log into the machine using SSH\
          \ and troubleshoot the problem. \n How to Access Data via SSH \n Launchpod\
          \ enables you to access the VM directly via SSH in order to modify the configuration\
          \ file  \n Configuration Guide \n The options selected within Launchpod\
          \ are used to populate Twitter Scraper's configuration file. Advanced users\
          \ may log into the VM using their ssh key and modify the configuration file\
          \ after deploying via Launchpod. The config file is located at /home/devel/twitterScraper-{version}/config.ini.\
          \  \n If the config file is modified, the harvester must be restarted before\
          \ any changes take effect. Restart the harvester using the command sudo\
          \ supervisorctl restart twitter_scraper. It is a good idea to change the\
          \ ouput path if you change the harvester settings, since Twitter Scraper\
          \ will overwrite an existing output spreadsheet if its output will have\
          \ the same name. \n Here is a sample configuration file: \n ```\n[main]\n\
          ; The [main] section contains the access tokens and consumer keys for the\
          \ Twitter application.\n; These are created and obtained from http://apps.twitter.com.\
          \ Each is required in order for\n; Twitter Scraper to work \n consumerKey\
          \ =\nconsumerSecret =\ntoken =\ntokenSecret = \n ; The following section\
          \ is an example. Additional sections can be added with [2], [3], and so\
          \ forth. \n; Each section must have a unique outDir and at least one of:\
          \ phrase, location or user, in order for\n; Twitter Scraper to function.\
          \ \n [1] \n ; At least one of phrase, user or location is mandatory. \n\
          ; Multiple phrase, exclude, user, location and language are accepted on\
          \ unique lines. That is,\n; no more than one property per line. \n phrase\
          \ = \n; Not case-sensitive. Will match substring. Multiple lines beginning\
          \ with 'phrase =' will persist \n; all tweets that match any phrase. Multiple\
          \ words in one phrase property will persist tweets that\n; contain all words\
          \ in that property in any order. A phrase property in quotation marks will\
          \ only match \n; tweets that contain that exact phrase.\n;\n; Example:\n\
          ; phrase = Phrase1\n; phrase = Phrase2\n; will match tweets that contain\
          \ either Phrase1 or Phrase2.\n;\n; phrase = Phrase1 Phrase2\n; will match\
          \ tweets that contain both Phrase1 and Phrase2.\n;\n; phrase = \"Phrase1\
          \ Phrase2\"\n; will match tweets that contain the exact string \"Phrase1\
          \ Phrase2\"\n;\n; As phrases will match a substring, searching for hashtags\
          \ need not include the hash character. Example:\n; phrase = hashtag\n; will\
          \ return tweets containing the string hashtag and #hashtag, whereas\n; phrase\
          \ = #hashtag\n; will not necessarily return tweets containing the string\
          \ hashtag (unless they are matched by another\n; property) \n exclude =\
          \ \n; Works exactly like the phrase property, but instead of persisting\
          \ its matches, exclude blocks them from \n; persisting. Tweets that match\
          \ a phrase property will out persist if they also match an exclude property.\n\
          ; Exclude cannot be the only matching property. \n user =\n; Not case-sensitive.\
          \ Will not match substring. Each user property must be a Twitter username.\n\
          ; Must not be preceded with @, or it will not match the desired user. \n\
          ; user = foo will match all tweets by user @foo. \n location = S,W,N,E\n\
          ; The location property can be used to match tweets that are geotagged and\
          \ fall inside a specified rectangle.\n; The location property takes exactly\
          \ four arguments, each a number between -180 and +180. The arguments \n\
          ; correspond to the south-most extent, the west-most, the north-most and\
          \ the east-most, and they must occur \n; in that exact order.\n; Given that\
          \ many users do not geotag their tweets due to privacy concerns, setting\
          \ this option may\n; severely limit the number of tweets harvested. \n language\
          \ =\n; The language property can be used to restrict the output to tweets\
          \ in a particular language as determined\n; by Twitter's language detection\
          \ system. Languages are represented by their 2-digit identifier. The list\n\
          ; of supported languages is  \n ; If distinct matching properties are used\
          \ in conjunction with one another, each matching option serves to \n; restrict\
          \ the others.\n;\n; Example:\n; user = foo\n; phrase = bar\n; will only\
          \ match tweets by the user '@foo' that contain the string 'bar', rather\
          \ than all tweets by user \n; '@foo' and all tweets containing 'bar'  \n\
          \ outPeriod = [hourly|daily|weekly|monthly] \n; Period to which a single\
          \ output csv file will correspond to. If this property is not included in\
          \ the config\n; file, all tweets will be appended to a single csv spreadsheet.\

          \ their timeline, an instruction to disregard the status is sent via the\
          \ Stream API. Due to the way Twitter Scraper outputs tweets, by appending\
          \ them to a csv text file, the instruction to disregard a tweet cannot be\
          \ honoured. This means that tweets that have harvested and then deleted\

        description: "<h1>Twitter Scraper User Guide</h1>\n<h2>Description</h2>\n\
          <p>Twitter Scraper is a tool developed by Intersect for use in collecting\
          \ data directly from the Twitter Stream API based on a variety of parameters,\
          \ including hashtags and phrases, users, location and language, and outputs\
          \ matching tweets to a comma separated values (.csv) spreadsheet for analysis.</p>\n\
          <h2>Target Audience</h2>\n<p>Twitter Scraper is available for use by any\
          \ researcher with an account at an Australian research institution that\
          \ subscribes to the <a href=\"http://aaf.edu.au\">Australian Access Federation</a>\
          \ (see the <a href=\"http://aaf.edu.au/subscribe/subscribers/\">full list\
          \ of AAF subscribers</a>). Researchers who want to incorporate data from\
          \ Twitter into their research are encouraged to use Twitter Scraper as a\
          \ powerful, though relatively easy, service which can be run on the <a href=\"\
          http://cloud.nectar.org.au/\">NeCTAR Research Cloud</a>. NeCTAR offer VMs\
          \ to researchers for free for a trial period, or longer periods under a\
          \ merit allocation scheme. Twitter Scraper itself is completely free for\
          \ researchers.</p>\n<h2>How to Launch</h2>\n<p>Twitter Scraper is deployed\
          \ through <a href=\"http://launchpod.intersect.org.au\">Launchpod</a>, a\
          \ web utility for configuring and deploying virtual machines (VMs) onto\
          \ the NeCTAR Research Cloud. Launchpod allows for users with little or no\
          \ experience with cloud computing to configure and deploy Twitter Scraper\
          \ easily and quickly. Before deploying Twitter Scraper, please refer to\
          \ the <a href=\"../Launchpod-doc\">documentation</a> for deploying VMs using\
          \ Launchpod.</p>\n<p>If you intend to log into Twitter Scraper via SSH,\
          \ for example to modify the harvester settings after it has been deployed,\
          \ you must specify an SSH keypair in Launchpod. Please follow the instructions\
          \ in the <a href=\"../Launchpod-doc\">Launchpod user guide</a> or at <a\
          \ href=\"http://cloud.nectar.org.au/\">NeCTAR Research Cloud</a> on how\
          \ to do so.</p>\n<h3>Obtaining Twitter access credentials</h3>\n<p><strong>Important:</strong>\
          \ <em>The steps to obtain your Twitter access tokens and consumer API keys\
          \ only need to be done once. If you intend to deploy more Twitter Scrapers,\
          \ you should use the same access tokens and credentials. You can always\
          \ log into the Twitter Applications Development site to get access tokens\
          \ you've already generated, or you can keep them in a safe place for later\
          \ use.</em></p>\n<p>Twitter Scraper uses your Twitter account to monitor\
          \ the constant stream of tweets and find those matching your specified search\
          \ terms. Before you can use Twitter Scraper, you need to create an \u2018\
          application\u2019 within Twitter, and then obtain the Consumer Key and the\
          \ Consumer Secret from this application, as well as your Access Token and\
          \ Access Token Secret.</p>\n<p>First, navigate to the <a href=\"https://apps.twitter.com\"\
          >Twitter Applications Development</a> site and log in with your Twitter\
          \ credentials. From here you will create the \u2018application\u2019. This\
          \ page is typically used by developers to register apps that they have created\
          \ and which people can download. Most of the information is actually irrelevant\
          \ for Twitter Scraper, but it needs to be entered in order to create the\
          \ access credentials that Twitter Scraper needs. As of mid-2015, you need\
          \ to have a mobile phone number associated with your Twitter account to\
          \ register an application. If you don't have a mobile number, go to your\
          \ Twitter profile and enter one.</p>\n<p>Click Create New App and provide\
          \ a name (such as \u2018Twitter Scraper\u2019) and a brief description (such\
          \ as \u2018this is an app to harvest tweets\u2019). You also need to provide\
          \ a URL. It does not have to be a real website, but it does have to begin\
          \ with <code>http://</code>. A dummy URL like <code>http://www.example.com</code>\
          \ is sufficient. Scroll to the end of the page and select 'Yes, I agree\
          \ to the Developer Agreement'. Finally, click 'Create your Twitter Application'.</p>\n\
          <p>Once your app has been created, navigate to the \u2018Keys and Access\
          \ Tokens\u2019 tab of the app settings. This page will display two of the\
          \ four settings you need, the Consumer Key (API Key) and the Consumer Secret\
          \ (API Secret). You can copy these straight out of Twitter and into a note\
          \ or document for use later, or put them directly into the relevant fields\
          \ in Launchpod.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"screenshot_consumerKey\" src=\"https://github.com/NeCTAR-RC/nectarcloud-tier0doco/blob/master/articles/NeCTAR%20Documentation--DOCID16/Tools%20and%20Apps--DOCID24/images/twitterDOCID88_consumerKey.png?raw=true\"\
          \ title=\"Consumer Key\"></p>\n<p>To generate the other two credentials,\
          \ scroll to the bottom of the same page and under 'Your Access Token' click\
          \ the button 'Create my access token'. The page will reload, and the Access\
          \ Token and the Access Token Secret will be displayed at the end. Make sure\
          \ when copying the Access Token that you copy the whole line including the\
          \ 9-digit number at the front, which is the same as your owner ID. The Launchpod\
          \ Twitter Scraper will not function without this.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"screenshot_accessToken\"\
          \ src=\"https://github.com/NeCTAR-RC/nectarcloud-tier0doco/blob/master/articles/NeCTAR%20Documentation--DOCID16/Tools%20and%20Apps--DOCID24/images/twitterDOCID88_accessToken.png?raw=true\"\
          \ title=\"Access Token\"></p>\n<p>Now that you have all of the access credentials\
          \ needed to deploy Twitter Scraper, you can begin configuring the tweet\
          \ harvesting parameters.</p>\n<h3>Specifying Harvest Parameters</h3>\n<p>Twitter\
          \ Scraper search parameters need to be configured prior to the deployment\
          \ of the server. Once it is deployed, you cannot change the search settings\
          \ without logging in to the VM via SSH. Harvest parameters are split into\
          \ two categories: <a href=\"#matching-options\">Matching Options</a>, what\
          \ Twitter Scraper will search for; and <a href=\"#output-options\">Output\
          \ Options</a>, how Twitter Scraper will format and configure the output\
          \ CSV file.</p>\n<h4>Matching options</h4>\n<h5>Phrases</h5>\n<p>This is\
          \ where you will enter the search terms and hashtags that Twitter Scraper\
          \ will monitor the Twitter stream for. You can set search phrases in a number\
          \ of ways. To search for an individual word, enter a single word and hit\
          \ return. If you want to search for tweets that contain multiple words in\
          \ any order, enter each word and hit return. If you want to search for an\
          \ exact phrase, enclose the phrase in double quotes before hitting return.\
          \ The example below will return any tweet that contains the word \u2018\
          Launchpod\u2019, in addition to any tweet that contains both the words \u2018\
          Intersect\u2019 and \u2018Australia\u2019, in addition to any tweet that\
          \ contains the exact phrase \u2018Twitter Scraper\u2019.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\
          screenshot_include_1\" src=\"https://github.com/NeCTAR-RC/nectarcloud-tier0doco/blob/master/articles/NeCTAR%20Documentation--DOCID16/Tools%20and%20Apps--DOCID24/images/twitterDOCID88_include_1.png?raw=true\"\
          \ title=\"Included phrases\"></p>\n<p>In other words, each search term is\
          \ separated by an implicit OR operation, and every word inside a search\
          \ term (such as \u2018Intersect Australia\u2019 above) is separated by an\
          \ implicit AND operation. Lastly, any phrase in double quotes will match\
          \ only those tweets that contain that exact phrase. You can also mix multiple\
          \ words and exact phrases in a single search term, such as the search term\
          \ below, which will return only tweets that contain the exact phrase \u2018\
          Twitter Scraper\u2019 as well as both words \u2018Intersect\u2019 and \u2018\
          Australia\u2019.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"screenshot_include_2\" src=\"https://github.com/NeCTAR-RC/nectarcloud-tier0doco/blob/master/articles/NeCTAR%20Documentation--DOCID16/Tools%20and%20Apps--DOCID24/images/twitterDOCID88_include_2.png?raw=true\"\
          \ title=\"Included phrases\"></p>\n<h5>Exclude Phrases</h5>\n<p>This field\
          \ is used to block the persistence of tweets that match the pattern. Exclusion\
          \ overrules inclusion, meaning that even if a tweet matches every inclusion\
          \ parameter, if it matches a single exclusion parameter, it will not be\
          \ included in the output. The excluded phrases field works exactly like\
          \ the phrases field in the interpretation of terms.</p>\n<h5>Users</h5>\n\
          <p>You may also specify particular users you want to include in your search\
          \ using the users field. If you leave this blank, the effect will be that\
          \ all users are included in the harvest. If you have just one username entered,\
          \ only tweets from that user will be included in the output. If you need\
          \ to include a large list of usernames, you can paste a list of usernames\
          \ separated by commas.</p>\n<p>If you specify both a set of users and a\
          \ set of phrases for your harvest parameters, both criteria must be satisfied\
          \ for a tweet to be harvested. In otherwords, only tweets by users specified\
          \ in your Users <em>and</em> which satisfy your phrase search will be harvested.\
          \ You may specify a set of users, or just a single user, without specifying\
          \ search phrases, in which case all tweets by those users will be harvested.</p>\n\
          <h5>Location</h5>\n<p>Checking the \u2018Set Location Bounds\u2019 will\
          \ open a map window in which you can define a bounding box. Only tweets\
          \ that are geocoded as originating from inside that box will be included\
          \ in the output. Tweets that originated from outside the bounding box will\
          \ not be harvested, nor will tweets that are not geocoded. Remember that\
          \ users can switch off geocoding, and many do for privacy reasons.</p>\n\
          <h5>Languages</h5>\n<p>You can use the Languages field to restrict your\
          \ search to tweets in that language. You can also select multiple languages.\
          \ The effect of selecting no language here is analogous to selecting no\
          \ users; any tweet will match irrespective of its language value. Tweets\
          \ are identified as being in a particular language automatically by machine\
          \ detection, and this may not work perfectly.</p>\n<h4>Output Options</h4>\n\
          <h5>Output Fields</h5>\n<p>The output fields allows you to customise the\
          \ spreadsheet output containing the tweets. By default, all elements are\
          \ included, but you can uncheck any of the checkboxes if you do not want\
          \ to include a particular tweet attribute in your output.</p>\n<h5>Treat\
          \ Hashtags Independently</h5>\n<p>This setting modified the behaviour of\
          \ Twitter Scraper when tweets contain multiple hashtags. Hashtags are parsed\
          \ out of the content of the tweet body and sent to a separate column of\
          \ the spreadsheet output. If this box is left unchecked, a tweet containing\
          \ more than one tweet will occur once in the spreadsheet, and both hashtags\
          \ will be written to the hashtag column. If this box is checked, then the\
          \ tweet will be repeated in the output spreadsheet, once for each hashtag,\
          \ and the hashtag column will contain only one hashtag. This may be useful\
          \ if you intend to process the output of the scraper using hashtags. If\
          \ you only intend to analyse the tweet body, you may want to leave this\
          \ box unchecked so as not to have repeats of the tweet.</p>\n<h5>De-Identify</h5>\n\
          <p>This checkbox allows you to de-identify the tweets captured by the scraper,\
          \ which can be useful for research ethics and privacy concerns. When this\
          \ box is checked, the username column of the output will be replaced by\
          \ a string so that you cannot identify the user. However, since the same\
          \ username will be replaced by the same string each time, meaning you are\
          \ still able to track particular users\u2019 tweets. Note that selecting\
          \ the de-identify checkbox does not obscure usernames within the body text\
          \ of tweets.</p>\n<h5>Period</h5>\n<p>The period refers to the time interval\
          \ between each time Twitter Scraper writes the data out to a spreadsheet.\
          \ The output works by filling a cached buffer of tweets as they emerge in\
          \ the Twitter stream and are captured by the scraper. The buffer can fit\
          \ a few dozen tweets. When the buffer fills, the content is appended to\
          \ a spreadsheet. When the period ends and the next period begins (that is,\
          \ the next hour if you select \u2018hourly\u2019), then a new spreadsheet\
          \ will be commenced. If you select \u2018none\u2019 as the period, then\
          \ every matching tweet will be written to the same spreadsheet. If your\
          \ scrape settings are broad and capture a lot of tweets, the spreadsheet\
          \ can blow out in size very quickly. Depending on how many tweets you expect\
          \ to match your search settings, you may want to set the period to daily,\
          \ or even hourly, to manage the size of the output spreadsheet.</p>\n<p>After\
          \ you have configured Twitter Scraper, you can now deploy it by clicking\
          \ \u2018Deploy\u2019. The process should only take around three minutes,\
          \ after which you will be sent an email letting you know that your Twitter\
          \ Scraper instance has been deployed. This email will also let you know\
          \ how you can access the data.</p>\n<h2>Accessing Data</h2>\n<p>Twitter\
          \ Scraper allows for two methods of accessing the data that it generates:\
          \ over http using a browser, or by logging in to the VM using SSH. Access\
          \ the machine via SSH also enables you to undertake further configuration\
          \ and advanced usage, such as modifying the harvest settings, restarting\
          \ the harvester or configuring additional harvests.</p>\n<h3>How to Access\
          \ Data via Web</h3>\n<p>While Twitter Scraper is operational, it will continue\
          \ to extract tweets from the Twitter Stream and, every time its buffer fills,\
          \ write those tweets to the csv file. A link to the location of the spreadsheet,\
          \ consisting of the IP address of the machine and a directory, such as <code>{IP\
          \ address}/1</code>, will be included in the email that Launchpod sends\
          \ you. Clicking this link will take you to a web view of a directory on\
          \ the VM containing a spreadsheet (or more) of Twitter Scraper's output\
          \ data. If you selected a time period, then you will see one spreadsheet\
          \ corresponding to each of that period that has begun since the VM was deployed.\
          \ </p>\n<p><img alt=\"screenshot_output\" src=\"https://github.com/NeCTAR-RC/nectarcloud-tier0doco/blob/master/articles/NeCTAR%20Documentation--DOCID16/Tools%20and%20Apps--DOCID24/images/twitterDOCID88_output.png?raw=true\"\
          \ title=\"Sample output\"></p>\n<p>Due to the way Twitter Scraper is deployed,\
          \ there are no easy ways to see if it is working, until tweets begin to\
          \ appear in the spreadsheet, which, depending on the harvest settings, could\
          \ be a long time. That is, if you specific very specific search terms, you\
          \ might be waiting a long time for the buffer to fill and for the tweets\
          \ to be written to the spreadsheet, and in the meantime, you have no way\
          \ of knowing whether the lack of output is due to an error or a lack of\
          \ matching tweets. There is a log file which can be accessed by navigating\
          \ to the IP of the machine (sent to your email) followed by <code>/logs</code>.\
          \ If the scraper is working, this log file will display lines like:</p>\n\
          <p><code>2015-04-15 00:05:41,925 INFO  (LoggerTweetProcessor.java:42) -\
          \ [1] Processed 10 tweets</code></p>\n<p>If the log file shows an error\
          \ or java exception instead, then you may have configured the machine incorrectly.\
          \ You should delete the instance and try again, paying particular attention\
          \ to the Twitter API Access Tokens and Consumer Keys. Alternatively, you\
          \ can log into the machine using SSH and <a href=\"#troubleshooting\">troubleshoot</a>\
          \ the problem.</p>\n<h3>How to Access Data via SSH</h3>\n<p>Launchpod enables\
          \ you to access the VM directly via SSH in order to modify the <a href=\"\
          #configuration-guide\">configuration</a> file </p>\n<h2>Configuration Guide</h2>\n\
          <p>The options selected within Launchpod are used to populate Twitter Scraper's\
          \ configuration file. Advanced users may log into the VM using their ssh\
          \ key and modify the configuration file after deploying via Launchpod. The\
          \ config file is located at <code>/home/devel/twitterScraper-{version}/config.ini</code>.\
          \ </p>\n<p>If the config file is modified, the harvester must be restarted\
          \ before any changes take effect. Restart the harvester using the command\
          \ <code>sudo supervisorctl restart twitter_scraper</code>. It is a good\
          \ idea to change the ouput path if you change the harvester settings, since\
          \ Twitter Scraper will overwrite an existing output spreadsheet if its output\
          \ will have the same name.</p>\n<p>Here is a sample configuration file:</p>\n\
          <p>```\n[main]\n; The [main] section contains the access tokens and consumer\
          \ keys for the Twitter application.\n; These are created and obtained from\
          \ http://apps.twitter.com. Each is required in order for\n; Twitter Scraper\
          \ to work</p>\n<p>consumerKey =\nconsumerSecret =\ntoken =\ntokenSecret\
          \ =</p>\n<p>; The following section is an example. Additional sections can\
          \ be added with [2], [3], and so forth. \n; Each section must have a unique\
          \ outDir and at least one of: phrase, location or user, in order for\n;\
          \ Twitter Scraper to function.</p>\n<p>[1]</p>\n<p>; At least one of phrase,\
          \ user or location is mandatory. \n; Multiple phrase, exclude, user, location\
          \ and language are accepted on unique lines. That is,\n; no more than one\
          \ property per line.</p>\n<p>phrase = \n; Not case-sensitive. Will match\
          \ substring. Multiple lines beginning with 'phrase =' will persist \n; all\
          \ tweets that match any phrase. Multiple words in one phrase property will\
          \ persist tweets that\n; contain all words in that property in any order.\
          \ A phrase property in quotation marks will only match \n; tweets that contain\
          \ that exact phrase.\n;\n; Example:\n; phrase = Phrase1\n; phrase = Phrase2\n\
          ; will match tweets that contain either Phrase1 or Phrase2.\n;\n; phrase\
          \ = Phrase1 Phrase2\n; will match tweets that contain both Phrase1 and Phrase2.\n\
          ;\n; phrase = \"Phrase1 Phrase2\"\n; will match tweets that contain the\
          \ exact string \"Phrase1 Phrase2\"\n;\n; As phrases will match a substring,\
          \ searching for hashtags need not include the hash character. Example:\n\
          ; phrase = hashtag\n; will return tweets containing the string hashtag and\
          \ #hashtag, whereas\n; phrase = #hashtag\n; will not necessarily return\
          \ tweets containing the string hashtag (unless they are matched by another\n\
          ; property)</p>\n<p>exclude = \n; Works exactly like the phrase property,\
          \ but instead of persisting its matches, exclude blocks them from \n; persisting.\
          \ Tweets that match a phrase property will out persist if they also match\
          \ an exclude property.\n; Exclude cannot be the only matching property.</p>\n\
          <p>user =\n; Not case-sensitive. Will not match substring. Each user property\
          \ must be a Twitter username.\n; Must not be preceded with @, or it will\
          \ not match the desired user. \n; user = foo will match all tweets by user\
          \ @foo.</p>\n<p>location = S,W,N,E\n; The location property can be used\
          \ to match tweets that are geotagged and fall inside a specified rectangle.\n\
          ; The location property takes exactly four arguments, each a number between\
          \ -180 and +180. The arguments \n; correspond to the south-most extent,\
          \ the west-most, the north-most and the east-most, and they must occur \n\
          ; in that exact order.\n; Given that many users do not geotag their tweets\
          \ due to privacy concerns, setting this option may\n; severely limit the\
          \ number of tweets harvested.</p>\n<p>language =\n; The language property\
          \ can be used to restrict the output to tweets in a particular language\
          \ as determined\n; by Twitter's language detection system. Languages are\
          \ represented by their 2-digit identifier. The list\n; of supported languages\
          \ is </p>\n<p>; If distinct matching properties are used in conjunction\
          \ with one another, each matching option serves to \n; restrict the others.\n\
          ;\n; Example:\n; user = foo\n; phrase = bar\n; will only match tweets by\
          \ the user '@foo' that contain the string 'bar', rather than all tweets\
          \ by user \n; '@foo' and all tweets containing 'bar' </p>\n<p>outPeriod\

  html: "<h1>Twitter Scraper User Guide</h1>\n<h2>Description</h2>\n<p>Twitter Scraper\
    \ is a tool developed by Intersect for use in collecting data directly from the\
    \ Twitter Stream API based on a variety of parameters, including hashtags and\
    \ phrases, users, location and language, and outputs matching tweets to a comma\
    \ separated values (.csv) spreadsheet for analysis.</p>\n<h2>Target Audience</h2>\n\
    <p>Twitter Scraper is available for use by any researcher with an account at an\
    \ Australian research institution that subscribes to the <a href=\"http://aaf.edu.au\"\
    >Australian Access Federation</a> (see the <a href=\"http://aaf.edu.au/subscribe/subscribers/\"\
    >full list of AAF subscribers</a>). Researchers who want to incorporate data from\
    \ Twitter into their research are encouraged to use Twitter Scraper as a powerful,\
    \ though relatively easy, service which can be run on the <a href=\"http://cloud.nectar.org.au/\"\
    >NeCTAR Research Cloud</a>. NeCTAR offer VMs to researchers for free for a trial\
    \ period, or longer periods under a merit allocation scheme. Twitter Scraper itself\
    \ is completely free for researchers.</p>\n<h2>How to Launch</h2>\n<p>Twitter\
    \ Scraper is deployed through <a href=\"http://launchpod.intersect.org.au\">Launchpod</a>,\
    \ a web utility for configuring and deploying virtual machines (VMs) onto the\
    \ NeCTAR Research Cloud. Launchpod allows for users with little or no experience\
    \ with cloud computing to configure and deploy Twitter Scraper easily and quickly.\
    \ Before deploying Twitter Scraper, please refer to the <a href=\"../Launchpod-doc\"\
    >documentation</a> for deploying VMs using Launchpod.</p>\n<p>If you intend to\
    \ log into Twitter Scraper via SSH, for example to modify the harvester settings\
    \ after it has been deployed, you must specify an SSH keypair in Launchpod. Please\
    \ follow the instructions in the <a href=\"../Launchpod-doc\">Launchpod user guide</a>\
    \ or at <a href=\"http://cloud.nectar.org.au/\">NeCTAR Research Cloud</a> on how\
    \ to do so.</p>\n<h3>Obtaining Twitter access credentials</h3>\n<p><strong>Important:</strong>\
    \ <em>The steps to obtain your Twitter access tokens and consumer API keys only\
    \ need to be done once. If you intend to deploy more Twitter Scrapers, you should\
    \ use the same access tokens and credentials. You can always log into the Twitter\
    \ Applications Development site to get access tokens you've already generated,\
    \ or you can keep them in a safe place for later use.</em></p>\n<p>Twitter Scraper\
    \ uses your Twitter account to monitor the constant stream of tweets and find\
    \ those matching your specified search terms. Before you can use Twitter Scraper,\
    \ you need to create an \u2018application\u2019 within Twitter, and then obtain\
    \ the Consumer Key and the Consumer Secret from this application, as well as your\
    \ Access Token and Access Token Secret.</p>\n<p>First, navigate to the <a href=\"\
    https://apps.twitter.com\">Twitter Applications Development</a> site and log in\
    \ with your Twitter credentials. From here you will create the \u2018application\u2019\
    . This page is typically used by developers to register apps that they have created\
    \ and which people can download. Most of the information is actually irrelevant\
    \ for Twitter Scraper, but it needs to be entered in order to create the access\
    \ credentials that Twitter Scraper needs. As of mid-2015, you need to have a mobile\
    \ phone number associated with your Twitter account to register an application.\
    \ If you don't have a mobile number, go to your Twitter profile and enter one.</p>\n\
    <p>Click Create New App and provide a name (such as \u2018Twitter Scraper\u2019\
    ) and a brief description (such as \u2018this is an app to harvest tweets\u2019\
    ). You also need to provide a URL. It does not have to be a real website, but\
    \ it does have to begin with <code>http://</code>. A dummy URL like <code>http://www.example.com</code>\
    \ is sufficient. Scroll to the end of the page and select 'Yes, I agree to the\
    \ Developer Agreement'. Finally, click 'Create your Twitter Application'.</p>\n\
    <p>Once your app has been created, navigate to the \u2018Keys and Access Tokens\u2019\
    \ tab of the app settings. This page will display two of the four settings you\
    \ need, the Consumer Key (API Key) and the Consumer Secret (API Secret). You can\
    \ copy these straight out of Twitter and into a note or document for use later,\
    \ or put them directly into the relevant fields in Launchpod.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\
    screenshot_consumerKey\" src=\"https://github.com/NeCTAR-RC/nectarcloud-tier0doco/blob/master/articles/NeCTAR\
    \ Documentation--DOCID16/Tools and Apps--DOCID24/images/twitterDOCID88_consumerKey.png?raw=true\"\
    \ title=\"Consumer Key\"></p>\n<p>To generate the other two credentials, scroll\
    \ to the bottom of the same page and under 'Your Access Token' click the button\
    \ 'Create my access token'. The page will reload, and the Access Token and the\
    \ Access Token Secret will be displayed at the end. Make sure when copying the\
    \ Access Token that you copy the whole line including the 9-digit number at the\
    \ front, which is the same as your owner ID. The Launchpod Twitter Scraper will\
    \ not function without this.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"screenshot_accessToken\" src=\"\
    https://github.com/NeCTAR-RC/nectarcloud-tier0doco/blob/master/articles/NeCTAR\
    \ Documentation--DOCID16/Tools and Apps--DOCID24/images/twitterDOCID88_accessToken.png?raw=true\"\
    \ title=\"Access Token\"></p>\n<p>Now that you have all of the access credentials\
    \ needed to deploy Twitter Scraper, you can begin configuring the tweet harvesting\
    \ parameters.</p>\n<h3>Specifying Harvest Parameters</h3>\n<p>Twitter Scraper\
    \ search parameters need to be configured prior to the deployment of the server.\
    \ Once it is deployed, you cannot change the search settings without logging in\
    \ to the VM via SSH. Harvest parameters are split into two categories: <a href=\"\
    #matching-options\">Matching Options</a>, what Twitter Scraper will search for;\
    \ and <a href=\"#output-options\">Output Options</a>, how Twitter Scraper will\
    \ format and configure the output CSV file.</p>\n<h4>Matching options</h4>\n<h5>Phrases</h5>\n\
    <p>This is where you will enter the search terms and hashtags that Twitter Scraper\
    \ will monitor the Twitter stream for. You can set search phrases in a number\
    \ of ways. To search for an individual word, enter a single word and hit return.\
    \ If you want to search for tweets that contain multiple words in any order, enter\
    \ each word and hit return. If you want to search for an exact phrase, enclose\
    \ the phrase in double quotes before hitting return. The example below will return\
    \ any tweet that contains the word \u2018Launchpod\u2019, in addition to any tweet\
    \ that contains both the words \u2018Intersect\u2019 and \u2018Australia\u2019\
    , in addition to any tweet that contains the exact phrase \u2018Twitter Scraper\u2019\
    .</p>\n<p><img alt=\"screenshot_include_1\" src=\"https://github.com/NeCTAR-RC/nectarcloud-tier0doco/blob/master/articles/NeCTAR\
    \ Documentation--DOCID16/Tools and Apps--DOCID24/images/twitterDOCID88_include_1.png?raw=true\"\
    \ title=\"Included phrases\"></p>\n<p>In other words, each search term is separated\
    \ by an implicit OR operation, and every word inside a search term (such as \u2018\
    Intersect Australia\u2019 above) is separated by an implicit AND operation. Lastly,\
    \ any phrase in double quotes will match only those tweets that contain that exact\
    \ phrase. You can also mix multiple words and exact phrases in a single search\
    \ term, such as the search term below, which will return only tweets that contain\
    \ the exact phrase \u2018Twitter Scraper\u2019 as well as both words \u2018Intersect\u2019\
    \ and \u2018Australia\u2019.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"screenshot_include_2\" src=\"\
    https://github.com/NeCTAR-RC/nectarcloud-tier0doco/blob/master/articles/NeCTAR\
    \ Documentation--DOCID16/Tools and Apps--DOCID24/images/twitterDOCID88_include_2.png?raw=true\"\
    \ title=\"Included phrases\"></p>\n<h5>Exclude Phrases</h5>\n<p>This field is\
    \ used to block the persistence of tweets that match the pattern. Exclusion overrules\
    \ inclusion, meaning that even if a tweet matches every inclusion parameter, if\
    \ it matches a single exclusion parameter, it will not be included in the output.\
    \ The excluded phrases field works exactly like the phrases field in the interpretation\
    \ of terms.</p>\n<h5>Users</h5>\n<p>You may also specify particular users you\
    \ want to include in your search using the users field. If you leave this blank,\
    \ the effect will be that all users are included in the harvest. If you have just\
    \ one username entered, only tweets from that user will be included in the output.\
    \ If you need to include a large list of usernames, you can paste a list of usernames\
    \ separated by commas.</p>\n<p>If you specify both a set of users and a set of\
    \ phrases for your harvest parameters, both criteria must be satisfied for a tweet\
    \ to be harvested. In otherwords, only tweets by users specified in your Users\
    \ <em>and</em> which satisfy your phrase search will be harvested. You may specify\
    \ a set of users, or just a single user, without specifying search phrases, in\
    \ which case all tweets by those users will be harvested.</p>\n<h5>Location</h5>\n\
    <p>Checking the \u2018Set Location Bounds\u2019 will open a map window in which\
    \ you can define a bounding box. Only tweets that are geocoded as originating\
    \ from inside that box will be included in the output. Tweets that originated\
    \ from outside the bounding box will not be harvested, nor will tweets that are\
    \ not geocoded. Remember that users can switch off geocoding, and many do for\
    \ privacy reasons.</p>\n<h5>Languages</h5>\n<p>You can use the Languages field\
    \ to restrict your search to tweets in that language. You can also select multiple\
    \ languages. The effect of selecting no language here is analogous to selecting\
    \ no users; any tweet will match irrespective of its language value. Tweets are\
    \ identified as being in a particular language automatically by machine detection,\
    \ and this may not work perfectly.</p>\n<h4>Output Options</h4>\n<h5>Output Fields</h5>\n\
    <p>The output fields allows you to customise the spreadsheet output containing\
    \ the tweets. By default, all elements are included, but you can uncheck any of\
    \ the checkboxes if you do not want to include a particular tweet attribute in\
    \ your output.</p>\n<h5>Treat Hashtags Independently</h5>\n<p>This setting modified\
    \ the behaviour of Twitter Scraper when tweets contain multiple hashtags. Hashtags\
    \ are parsed out of the content of the tweet body and sent to a separate column\
    \ of the spreadsheet output. If this box is left unchecked, a tweet containing\
    \ more than one tweet will occur once in the spreadsheet, and both hashtags will\
    \ be written to the hashtag column. If this box is checked, then the tweet will\
    \ be repeated in the output spreadsheet, once for each hashtag, and the hashtag\
    \ column will contain only one hashtag. This may be useful if you intend to process\
    \ the output of the scraper using hashtags. If you only intend to analyse the\
    \ tweet body, you may want to leave this box unchecked so as not to have repeats\
    \ of the tweet.</p>\n<h5>De-Identify</h5>\n<p>This checkbox allows you to de-identify\
    \ the tweets captured by the scraper, which can be useful for research ethics\
    \ and privacy concerns. When this box is checked, the username column of the output\
    \ will be replaced by a string so that you cannot identify the user. However,\
    \ since the same username will be replaced by the same string each time, meaning\
    \ you are still able to track particular users\u2019 tweets. Note that selecting\
    \ the de-identify checkbox does not obscure usernames within the body text of\
    \ tweets.</p>\n<h5>Period</h5>\n<p>The period refers to the time interval between\
    \ each time Twitter Scraper writes the data out to a spreadsheet. The output works\
    \ by filling a cached buffer of tweets as they emerge in the Twitter stream and\
    \ are captured by the scraper. The buffer can fit a few dozen tweets. When the\
    \ buffer fills, the content is appended to a spreadsheet. When the period ends\
    \ and the next period begins (that is, the next hour if you select \u2018hourly\u2019\
    ), then a new spreadsheet will be commenced. If you select \u2018none\u2019 as\
    \ the period, then every matching tweet will be written to the same spreadsheet.\
    \ If your scrape settings are broad and capture a lot of tweets, the spreadsheet\
    \ can blow out in size very quickly. Depending on how many tweets you expect to\
    \ match your search settings, you may want to set the period to daily, or even\
    \ hourly, to manage the size of the output spreadsheet.</p>\n<p>After you have\
    \ configured Twitter Scraper, you can now deploy it by clicking \u2018Deploy\u2019\
    . The process should only take around three minutes, after which you will be sent\
    \ an email letting you know that your Twitter Scraper instance has been deployed.\
    \ This email will also let you know how you can access the data.</p>\n<h2>Accessing\
    \ Data</h2>\n<p>Twitter Scraper allows for two methods of accessing the data that\
    \ it generates: over http using a browser, or by logging in to the VM using SSH.\
    \ Access the machine via SSH also enables you to undertake further configuration\
    \ and advanced usage, such as modifying the harvest settings, restarting the harvester\
    \ or configuring additional harvests.</p>\n<h3>How to Access Data via Web</h3>\n\
    <p>While Twitter Scraper is operational, it will continue to extract tweets from\
    \ the Twitter Stream and, every time its buffer fills, write those tweets to the\
    \ csv file. A link to the location of the spreadsheet, consisting of the IP address\
    \ of the machine and a directory, such as <code>{IP address}/1</code>, will be\
    \ included in the email that Launchpod sends you. Clicking this link will take\
    \ you to a web view of a directory on the VM containing a spreadsheet (or more)\
    \ of Twitter Scraper's output data. If you selected a time period, then you will\
    \ see one spreadsheet corresponding to each of that period that has begun since\
    \ the VM was deployed. </p>\n<p><img alt=\"screenshot_output\" src=\"https://github.com/NeCTAR-RC/nectarcloud-tier0doco/blob/master/articles/NeCTAR\
    \ Documentation--DOCID16/Tools and Apps--DOCID24/images/twitterDOCID88_output.png?raw=true\"\
    \ title=\"Sample output\"></p>\n<p>Due to the way Twitter Scraper is deployed,\
    \ there are no easy ways to see if it is working, until tweets begin to appear\
    \ in the spreadsheet, which, depending on the harvest settings, could be a long\
    \ time. That is, if you specific very specific search terms, you might be waiting\
    \ a long time for the buffer to fill and for the tweets to be written to the spreadsheet,\
    \ and in the meantime, you have no way of knowing whether the lack of output is\
    \ due to an error or a lack of matching tweets. There is a log file which can\
    \ be accessed by navigating to the IP of the machine (sent to your email) followed\
    \ by <code>/logs</code>. If the scraper is working, this log file will display\
    \ lines like:</p>\n<p><code>2015-04-15 00:05:41,925 INFO  (LoggerTweetProcessor.java:42)\
    \ - [1] Processed 10 tweets</code></p>\n<p>If the log file shows an error or java\
    \ exception instead, then you may have configured the machine incorrectly. You\
    \ should delete the instance and try again, paying particular attention to the\
    \ Twitter API Access Tokens and Consumer Keys. Alternatively, you can log into\
    \ the machine using SSH and <a href=\"#troubleshooting\">troubleshoot</a> the\
    \ problem.</p>\n<h3>How to Access Data via SSH</h3>\n<p>Launchpod enables you\
    \ to access the VM directly via SSH in order to modify the <a href=\"#configuration-guide\"\
    >configuration</a> file </p>\n<h2>Configuration Guide</h2>\n<p>The options selected\
    \ within Launchpod are used to populate Twitter Scraper's configuration file.\
    \ Advanced users may log into the VM using their ssh key and modify the configuration\
    \ file after deploying via Launchpod. The config file is located at <code>/home/devel/twitterScraper-{version}/config.ini</code>.\
    \ </p>\n<p>If the config file is modified, the harvester must be restarted before\
    \ any changes take effect. Restart the harvester using the command <code>sudo\
    \ supervisorctl restart twitter_scraper</code>. It is a good idea to change the\
    \ ouput path if you change the harvester settings, since Twitter Scraper will\
    \ overwrite an existing output spreadsheet if its output will have the same name.</p>\n\
    <p>Here is a sample configuration file:</p>\n<p>```\n[main]\n; The [main] section\
    \ contains the access tokens and consumer keys for the Twitter application.\n\
    ; These are created and obtained from http://apps.twitter.com. Each is required\
    \ in order for\n; Twitter Scraper to work</p>\n<p>consumerKey =\nconsumerSecret\
    \ =\ntoken =\ntokenSecret =</p>\n<p>; The following section is an example. Additional\
    \ sections can be added with [2], [3], and so forth. \n; Each section must have\
    \ a unique outDir and at least one of: phrase, location or user, in order for\n\
    ; Twitter Scraper to function.</p>\n<p>[1]</p>\n<p>; At least one of phrase, user\
    \ or location is mandatory. \n; Multiple phrase, exclude, user, location and language\
    \ are accepted on unique lines. That is,\n; no more than one property per line.</p>\n\
    <p>phrase = \n; Not case-sensitive. Will match substring. Multiple lines beginning\
    \ with 'phrase =' will persist \n; all tweets that match any phrase. Multiple\
    \ words in one phrase property will persist tweets that\n; contain all words in\
    \ that property in any order. A phrase property in quotation marks will only match\
    \ \n; tweets that contain that exact phrase.\n;\n; Example:\n; phrase = Phrase1\n\
    ; phrase = Phrase2\n; will match tweets that contain either Phrase1 or Phrase2.\n\
    ;\n; phrase = Phrase1 Phrase2\n; will match tweets that contain both Phrase1 and\
    \ Phrase2.\n;\n; phrase = \"Phrase1 Phrase2\"\n; will match tweets that contain\
    \ the exact string \"Phrase1 Phrase2\"\n;\n; As phrases will match a substring,\
    \ searching for hashtags need not include the hash character. Example:\n; phrase\
    \ = hashtag\n; will return tweets containing the string hashtag and #hashtag,\
    \ whereas\n; phrase = #hashtag\n; will not necessarily return tweets containing\

          \ operating system \n \nGlossary of Terms  \n \n \n Introduction \n \n Description\
          \  \n Since cloud Virtual Machine (VM) images are restricted in size, it\
          \ is not possible to have a generic image containing all the different application\
          \ software that is available on high-performance computing (HPC) systems,\
          \ such as eResearchSA's Tizard supercomputer. Users have therefore needed\
          \ to find VM images that contain the software they need, or install it themselves.\
          \  \n eResearchSA has deployed a distributed software repository that enables\
          \ cloud virtual machines to easily access all the software applications\
          \ that are available on the Tizard supercomputer. Users can run any of this\
          \ software on the cloud virtual machine, just as they can on Tizard. \n\
          \ This service is designed for: \n \n Researchers who want to use cloud\
          \ virtual machines to run compute-intensive software applications \n Situations\
          \ where a single virtual machine image containing all the required software\
          \ is not available, and the researcher does not want to install the software\
          \ themselves. \n This service is currently only available for South Australian\
          \ users as it uses the eResearch SA software repository. \n \n CVMFS \n\
          \ The system makes use of a read-only, http-based distributed virtual file\
          \ system called the CERN VM File System (CVMFS), which CERN developed to\
          \ enable researchers to access their standard software packages at many\
          \ sites around the world. eRSA has set up a CVMFS server that provides access\
          \ to a repository of all the open-source software that is installed on eRSA's\
          \ HPC systems, and a NeCTAR cloud virtual machine image that contains a\
          \ CVMFS client that can access the software in the repository.  \n When\
          \ a user runs a software application on the cloud virtual machine, the software\
          \ is automatically downloaded from the CVMFS repository and stored locally\
          \ on the VM. The next time the same software is used, CVMFS uses the local\
          \ copy of the software so it will start up faster, without having to wait\
          \ for the download. \n For the user, this all happens transparently, it\
          \ appears as though all the application software is installed on the cloud\
          \ virtual machine. \n Glossary of Terms  \nTop of page \n \n Register for\
          \ an eRSA account \n To access the eRSA cloud software repository, you will\
          \ need to be [registered with eResearchSA].  Email the [eRSA Helpdesk][ServiceDesk]\
          \ with any queries. \n \n \n Getting a Project Allocation \n Researchers\
          \ will by default have a trial allocation on NeCTAR (project name pt-XXXXX;\
          \ 2 cores for 3 months). \n You will need to request a project allocation\
          \ for further resources if: \n \n you require more computing power or longer\
          \ term usage \n you wish to share cloud computing resources with your research\
          \ group \n \n Log in to the NeCTAR dashboard and click on New Request under\
          \ Allocations in the left hand side menu. Email the eRSA Helpdesk if you\
          \ have questions about any of the information in the form. New requests\
          \ can take a couple of weeks to process, and allocations are merit-based.\

          \ \n Contact eRSA to help set-up your instance \n Accessing the Cloud software\
          \ repository is as simple as launching an instance using a specific image\
          \ designed by eRSA staff, and knowing a few basic commands.   \n Email the\
          \ eRSA Helpdesk to inform them you want to set up a VM with access to the\
          \ software repository, and a support member will give you the name of the\
          \ current image that you will use.  You can use this information to launch\
          \ an instance, following the instructions below, or you can request that\
          \ eRSA set up the VM for you. \n Add your eRSA support contact to your project\
          \ users group \n After you have received a project allocation, you can add\
          \ collaborators as users to the project by selecting the Users tab in the\
          \ project menu on the dashboard and entering the institutional (AAF) email\
          \ address of your co-workers. \n It is recommended that you add the eRSA\
          \ email address of your eRSA support contact to the users of your project.\
          \ If you need any assistance in setting up or managing your VM, eRSA staff\
          \ will need to be a user on the project in order to provide some types of\
          \ assistance. \n Glossary of Terms \nTop of page \n \n \n Creating a security\
          \ group \n \n \n If you have not already done so, you will need to create\
          \ a security group with port 22 open for SSH access.  \n \n \n On the NeCTAR\
          \ dashboard, ensure you are in the correct project. \n \n \n \n \n Select\
          \ \"Access & Security\" under the left hand side pane under \"Compute\"\
          . \n \n Select the \"Create Security Group\" button near the top right corner\
          \ \n Give your security group a name and description and click the \"Create\
          \ Security Group\" button \n Click \"Manage Rules\" in the \"Actions\" drop-down\
          \ menu \n \n  Click on the \"Add Rule\" button near the top right corner\
          \  \n \n \n A small window should pop up. Make sure the \"Rule\" is set\
          \ to \"Custom TCP Rule\" \n  and \"Open Port\" is set to \"Port\". Under\
          \ the Port textbox enter \"22\". Set \"Remote\" \n  to \"CIDR\" and under\
          \ the \"CIDR\" textbox enter one of the following IP ranges as appropriate.\
          \ \n \n 129.127.0.0/16 - University of Adelaide \n 129.96.0.0/16 - Flinders\
          \ \n 130.220.0.0/16 - UniSA   \n \n \n E.g. for a user from the University\
          \ of Adelaide: \n \n \n Security and Access Tip: Using the IP ranges above\
          \ will limit VM access to computers connected to your university network.\
          \ If you would like to access the computers from home or elsewhere, you\
          \ will have to do this through a VPN connection with your university computer.\
          \ Alternatively, you can set the CIDR to '0.0.0.0/0' which will allow any\
          \ IP address to connect to the VM. This will reduce the security of your\
          \ VM, but you will be able to get SSH access with any computer at any location.\

          \ module or this guide for detailed instructions on launching an instance\
          \ if it is your first time and/or you haven't yet set up SSH keypairs. \n\
          \ \n \n In your project allocation on the NeCTAR dashboard, navigate to\
          \ the 'Instances' tab in the 'Compute' menu. \n \n \n  Select the \"Launch\
          \ Instance\" button near the top right corner \n \n \n Fill in a name for\
          \ the VM, choose an appropriate size (Flavor), then select the image name\
          \ provided by eRSA (the screenshot shows the image used for CVMFS access\
          \ at the time of writing this document). \n \n \n \n \n Click the 'Access\
          \ and Security' tab. Select your SSH keypair and select the security group\
          \ which allows access through port 22 for SSH (set up in the previous step).\
          \ \n \n \n \n Click the 'Availability Zone' tab and select 'sa', Then click\
          \ 'Launch' \n \n \n \n Once the Instance is running, use the IP Address\
          \ to connect to the VM via SSH in the usual way, as outlined in the Accessing\

          \ Loading the pre-installed software packages \n There are a few simple\
          \ commands to find software packages in the repository and load the environment\
          \ for the version of the software that you want. This is done using the\
          \ Environment Modules package. You must first load the module (using the\
          \ module load command) for the software you want before you run the software.\

          \ Ensure you mention that you would like to access it through cloud computing\
          \ on your VM. \n Glossary of Terms  \nTop of page \n \n \n Sharing files\
          \ with the virtual machine \n There is a training module and a support guide\
          \ with comprehensive details on transferring data between your VM and your\
          \ local computer or remote storage servers. Using programs like FileZilla\
          \ or WinSCP is an easy method of transferring data from your local computer.\
          \  \n The following information outlines commands that can be entered on\
          \ your VM in order to transfer data to and from remote data storage, such\
          \ as the storage offered by eRSA. There is also an eRSA support page with\
          \ more detail on transferring data from eRSA storage. \n Secure Copy (SCP)\
          \ between the VM and a data storage server \n If you have data stored on\
          \ a remote server, you can transfer files between it and the VM through\
          \ the command-line on the VM. \n You will need a host address for the data\
          \ storage server, your username, and your password. \n scp <source> <destination>\
          \ \n scp username@sftp.ersa.edu.au:/data/myDirectory/file.txt /mnt/data/\
          \ \nscp /mnt/data/results.zip username@sftp.ersa.edu.au:/data/myDirectory/\
          \ \n You will usually then be prompted to enter the password for your data\
          \ storage. \n \n SFTP via the Command Line \n Secure file transfer is also\
          \ available between the VM and remote data storage. This is useful when\
          \ you aren't sure of the file structure on the remote server, because it\
          \ allows you to navigate to a file before you download it. \n Enter the\
          \ 'sftp' command while logged on to your VM, and you will have access to\
          \ the remote storage server. \n sftp username@sftp.ersa.edu.au   - you will\
          \ be prompted for a password. \n You are now accessing the remote data storage\
          \ server, and you can navigate the files on the server as per usual with\
          \ commands like cd and ls. \nThe commands get and put will transfer data\
          \ between the machines:\n  \n   \n to close the sftp connection, type exit.\
          \ \n Glossary of Terms  \nTop of page \n \n \n The CentOS operating system\
          \ \n The VM image that allows access to the CVMFS software repository is\
          \ a Linux distribution called CentOS. Most of the documentation available\
          \ about using your Linux VM in the NeCTAR cloud assumes that you have an\
          \ Ubuntu operating system.  There is very little difference for the user\
          \ between these Linux operating systems, but there is one main difference\
          \ to be aware of. \n CentOS uses the package manager 'yum' instead of 'apt-get'.\
          \ If you need to install packages on your VM that aren't in the CVMFS software\
          \ repository, you need to use the 'yum' command wherever there would be\
          \ an 'apt-get' command in Ubuntu. e.g. \n \n yum search <package name> \n\
          \ sudo yum install <package name> \n sudo yum update \n \n Top of page \n\
          \ \n \n Glossary \n Availability Zone \n \n A logical grouping of compute\
          \ nodes within a region. \n \n Dashboard \n \n The NeCTAR Dashboard is the\
          \ main web-based interface for managing NeCTAR virtuals. \n \n ERSA \n \n\
          \ eResearch SA runs the South Australian node of the NeCTAR research cloud.\
          \ \n \n Flavor \n \n An OpenStack term for an instance sizing specification.\
          \ Gives the amount \nof memory, number of VCPUs and ephemeral disk size.\
          \ \n \n Image \n \n An image (or system image) is a copy of the entire state\
          \ of a computer system \nsaved as a file. Images are used in two ways in\
          \ NeCTAR. Firstly as a template for \nVirtual Machines (VMs). You can launch\
          \ a VM based on an image. \nThe second use of images is to preserve the\
          \ state of a VM as configured by you as end user. \nThis type of image is\
          \ usually referred to as a snapshot. \n \n Instance \n \n An instance is\
          \ a VM hosted on the NeCTAR OpenStack infrastructure. \n \n Modules \n \n\
          \ Environment modules are used to configure a users environment to allow\
          \ use of the software packages available on the server. The module commands\
          \ are used to find information on the available packages, and to load the\
          \ packages for use. \n \n Node (compute node)  \n \n OpenStack terminology\
          \ for a physical computer used to run virtual machines. It will typically\
          \ have multiple CPUs and shared memory, and one or more network interfaces.\
          \ It may also have on-node disk storage. \n \n Project \n \n The NeCTAR\
          \ term for a \"resource container\"; i.e. what you get when you \nare granted\
          \ a NeCTAR allocation. A project \"owns\" virtual machine instances, snapshots\
          \ \nand various kinds of storage, and may be shared by multiple users. \n\
          \ \n Security Group \n \n A set of access rules that may be applied to one\
          \ or more instances. \nAn access rule allows network access to an instance\
          \ from other hosts with a \nspecified combination of protocol family (e.g.\
          \ TCP, UDP, UCMP), port number and address range. Security Groups page \n\
          \ \n SSH \n \n A protocol and tools for establishing secure \"shell\" sessions\
          \ over the network. SSH encrypts the data transferred, and supports user\
          \ authentication using public/private keys. \n \n Tizard \n \n Tizard is\
          \ eRSA's high performance computing server that can be used for complex\
          \ data processing and analysis jobs that standard desktop computers would\
          \ find it difficult or impossible to perform. It enables users to run many\
          \ processing jobs with different parameters or input files more quickly.\
          \ \n \n Virtual Machine \n \n A virtual machine (VM) is an operating system\
          \ (OS) or application environment that \nis installed on software which\
          \ imitates dedicated hardware. The end user has the same \nexperience on\
          \ a virtual machine as they would have on dedicated hardware. \n \n Volume\
          \ Storage \n \n Data Storage in your Virtual Machine that works like a hard-drive\
          \ on your PC or \nlaptop does. Volume storage is automatically available\
          \ in your VM as the storage \nspace for you system drive. Some flavors of\
          \ VMs include an amount of ephemeral volume \nstorage. Depending on your\
          \ allocation you can have persistent volume storage attached to your VM.\

          \ all the software applications that are available on the Tizard supercomputer.\
          \ Users can run any of this software on the cloud virtual machine, just\
          \ as they can on Tizard.</p>\n<p>This service is designed for:</p>\n<ul>\n\
          <li>Researchers who want to use cloud virtual machines to run compute-intensive\
          \ software applications</li>\n<li>Situations where a single virtual machine\
          \ image containing all the required software is not available, and the researcher\
          \ does not want to install the software themselves.</li>\n<li>This service\
          \ is currently only available for South Australian users as it uses the\
          \ eResearch SA software repository.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>CVMFS</h2>\n<p>The\
          \ system makes use of a read-only, http-based distributed virtual file system\
          \ called the <a href=\"http://cernvm.cern.ch/portal/startcvmfs\">CERN VM\
          \ File System</a> (CVMFS), which CERN developed to enable researchers to\
          \ access their standard software packages at many sites around the world.\
          \ eRSA has set up a CVMFS server that provides access to a repository of\
          \ all the open-source software that is installed on eRSA's HPC systems,\
          \ and a NeCTAR cloud virtual machine image that contains a CVMFS client\
          \ that can access the software in the repository. </p>\n<p>When a user runs\
          \ a software application on the cloud virtual machine, the software is automatically\
          \ downloaded from the CVMFS repository and stored locally on the VM. The\
          \ next time the same software is used, CVMFS uses the local copy of the\
          \ software so it will start up faster, without having to wait for the download.</p>\n\
          <p>For the user, this all happens transparently, it appears as though all\
          \ the application software is installed on the cloud virtual machine.</p>\n\

    </ul>\n<hr>\n<h2>Introduction <a name=\"intro\"></a></h2>\n<p>Description </p>\n\
    <p>Since cloud Virtual Machine (VM) images are restricted in size, it is not possible\
    \ to have a generic image containing all the different application software that\
    \ is available on high-performance computing (HPC) systems, such as eResearchSA's\
    \ <a href=\"https://www.ersa.edu.au/tizard/\">Tizard supercomputer</a>. Users\
    \ have therefore needed to find VM images that contain the software they need,\
    \ or install it themselves. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ersa.edu.au/\">eResearchSA</a>\
    \ has deployed a distributed software repository that enables cloud virtual machines\
    \ to easily access all the software applications that are available on the Tizard\
    \ supercomputer. Users can run any of this software on the cloud virtual machine,\
    \ just as they can on Tizard.</p>\n<p>This service is designed for:</p>\n<ul>\n\
    <li>Researchers who want to use cloud virtual machines to run compute-intensive\
    \ software applications</li>\n<li>Situations where a single virtual machine image\
    \ containing all the required software is not available, and the researcher does\
    \ not want to install the software themselves.</li>\n<li>This service is currently\
    \ only available for South Australian users as it uses the eResearch SA software\
    \ repository.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>CVMFS</h2>\n<p>The system makes use of a read-only,\
    \ http-based distributed virtual file system called the <a href=\"http://cernvm.cern.ch/portal/startcvmfs\"\
    >CERN VM File System</a> (CVMFS), which CERN developed to enable researchers to\
    \ access their standard software packages at many sites around the world. eRSA\
    \ has set up a CVMFS server that provides access to a repository of all the open-source\
    \ software that is installed on eRSA's HPC systems, and a NeCTAR cloud virtual\
    \ machine image that contains a CVMFS client that can access the software in the\
    \ repository. </p>\n<p>When a user runs a software application on the cloud virtual\
    \ machine, the software is automatically downloaded from the CVMFS repository\
    \ and stored locally on the VM. The next time the same software is used, CVMFS\
    \ uses the local copy of the software so it will start up faster, without having\
    \ to wait for the download.</p>\n<p>For the user, this all happens transparently,\
    \ it appears as though all the application software is installed on the cloud\
    \ virtual machine.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#glossary\">Glossary of Terms</a> <br>\n\

          \ to start\nincorporating cloud computing into you research practice. The\
          \ cloud can enable\nyou to access your computing from anywhere, have it\
          \ running 24/7, and provide a\nbasic space to collaborate, whether your\
          \ collaborators are down the hall, or many\ntime zones away.  \n TPAC provides\
          \ and maintains a number of server images that make \u2018owning\u2019 a\
          \ remote\ndesktop very easy. This document is about the TPAC RStudio image.\
          \ By following the\ninstructions below you can quickly have an RStudio remote\
          \ desktop running in the\nNeCTAR cloud. \n What you need \n Aside from computer\
          \ and network access, you will need to be an Australian Access Federation\n\
          eligible researcher to access the NeCTAR cloud. You will also have to use\
          \ key-pair\nsecurity for your virtual machine authentication.\nUpon first\
          \ NeCTAR cloud use, AAF eligible researchers are issued with a limited\n\
          trial allocation that will do just fine for trialling the\nTPAC RStudio\
          \ in the research cloud. If you need more resources, such as CPU, data\n\
          storage space, or you need it for longer than your trial allocation, then\
          \ you can\nrequest a NeCTAR allocation. \n Launch an RStudio remote desktop\
          \ \n To launch an RStudio remote desktop follow these steps: \n Log in to\
          \ your NeCTAR Dashboard, and if you have access to more than\none allocation,\
          \ ensure that your project selector (top left on the Dashboard, is\nset\
          \ to the project of your choice). \n There are a few variations of launching\
          \ a VM instance from an image, here we will\nnavigate to images under Compute\
          \ on the left hand side of the Dashboard. The Images\nlist displays, you\
          \ will need to the Public images filter button on the top right\nof the\
          \ list. In the list of Public images, find the image named \u201CTPAC rstudio.xxx\
          \ yyyyy\u201D\nwhere xxx and yyyyy are mere version numbers. On the right\
          \ in this image table,\nclick the image\u2019s Launch action button.  \n\
          \ \n The Launch Instance dialog displays.  \n On the Details tab of the\
          \ dialog, enter the instance Name, and select a Flavor\nwith a minimum of\
          \ 10GB root disk (Flavor is Nectar for size of your VM). The Image\nname\
          \ \"TPAC rstudio.xxx ...\" is already selected. \n On the Access & Security\
          \ tab, select your key pair, and select one or more security\ngroups to\
          \ apply to your VM. To complete the instructions in this document, you will\n\
          need a security group that allows SSH \n If you have any specific reason\
          \ to run your VM in a specific availability zone, \nyou can select it on\
          \ the Availability Zone tab. Alternatively you can let NeCTAR\ndecide where\
          \ best to host your VM by leaving the selector on \u201CAny availability\
          \ zone\u201D. \n You don\u2019t have to change anything on the \u201Cpost-Creation\
          \ and Advanced Options tabs. \n Click Launch. Launching should complete\
          \ in minutes. When your instance has\nsuccessfully launched, the Dashboard\
          \ will show your the IP Address of your VM.  \n \n Connecting to your RStudio\
          \ remote desktop using X2Go \n The RStudio you launched using the TPAC Rstudio\
          \ image has the X2Go remote desktop\nservice and the MATE GUI provider preinstalled.\
          \ So your VM is ready for for it. \n Your local computer will need the X2Go\
          \ client software installed. If you don\u2019t\nalready have the X2Go Client\
          \ on your machine, you can find the instructions for\nyou Operating System\
          \ under X2Go Client Installation in Getting Started with TPAC\nremote desktop.\
          \ \n When you have the X2Go client installed you will need to create a \u201C\
          Session\u201D. At\nits most basic you will need the IP Address of the remote\
          \ desktop RStudio VM\nyou\u2019ve launched, the user name for your VM (TPAC\
          \ RStudio image provides you with\nthe ubuntu username by default) and your\
          \ private key. Detailed instructions can be\nfound under Use X2Go Client\
          \ in document TPAC Remote Desktop X2Go, but the\nscreenshot below should\
          \ give you the basic idea. \n \n When you're successfully connected, you\
          \ can find the RStudio in the menu (top left)\nunder Applications | Programming\
          \ \n \n What\u2019s on my RStudio remote desktop instance \n In the building\
          \ process for the TPAC RStudio image, the software that will be\ninstalled\

          \ use your VM as collaboration space, you will need to do some user\nmanagement.\
          \ For this you can refer to \u201CAdd Accounts on The X2Go Server\u201D\
          \ in TPAC\nRemote Desktop X2go documentation. On top of that, your collaborators\
          \ will need\nto install their own X2Go client, refer above. \n Your TPAC\
          \ image based RStudio remote desktop instance is also an RStudio Server.\n\
          With some user management, and some NeCTAR security settings, you can get\
          \ or\ngive access to your RStudio VM using a web-browser. For more info\
          \ on this you can\nview skip to the bottom of Step 2 of the instructions\
          \ at TPAC RStudio Server \n Additionally your VM is also a Shiny Server\
          \ for interactive R-backed web applications. \nLearn more at the Shiny Server\
          \ websiteshiny. You will need to some allow connections to\ntcp port 3838\
          \ in the Nectar security settings to allow access to your Shiny Server\n\
          on your VM. \n You can create a Shared Data Folder on the Remote Server.\
          \ Head over to here to\nfind out how. \n Contact \n If you have trouble\
          \ with TPAC R-Studio image, please contact TPAC help desk via\nhelpdesk@tpac.org.au,\

  html: "<p>Using remote desktop in the NeCTAR cloud is the easiest way to start\n\
    incorporating cloud computing into you research practice. The cloud can enable\n\
    you to access your computing from anywhere, have it running 24/7, and provide\
    \ a\nbasic space to collaborate, whether your collaborators are down the hall,\
    \ or many\ntime zones away. </p>\n<p>TPAC provides and maintains a number of server\
    \ images that make \u2018owning\u2019 a remote\ndesktop very easy. This document\
    \ is about the TPAC RStudio image. By following the\ninstructions below you can\
    \ quickly have an RStudio remote desktop running in the\nNeCTAR cloud.</p>\n<h2>What\
    \ you need</h2>\n<p>Aside from computer and network access, you will need to be\
    \ an <a href=\"https://support.nectar.org.au/support/solutions/articles/6000055377-getting-an-account\"\
    >Australian Access Federation</a>\neligible researcher to access the NeCTAR cloud.\
    \ You will also have to use key-pair\nsecurity for your <a href=\"https://support.nectar.org.au/support/solutions/articles/6000077794-getting-started\"\
    >virtual machine authentication</a>.\nUpon first NeCTAR cloud use, AAF eligible\
    \ researchers are issued with a limited\n<a href=\"https://support.nectar.org.au/support/solutions/articles/6000055380-resources-available-to-you\"\
    >trial allocation</a> that will do just fine for trialling the\nTPAC RStudio in\
    \ the research cloud. If you need more resources, such as CPU, data\nstorage space,\
    \ or you need it for longer than your trial allocation, then you can\nrequest\
    \ a <a href=\"https://support.nectar.org.au/support/solutions/articles/6000068044-managing-an-allocation\"\
    >NeCTAR allocation</a>.</p>\n<h2>Launch an RStudio remote desktop</h2>\n<p>To\
    \ launch an RStudio remote desktop follow these steps:</p>\n<p>Log in to your\
    \ NeCTAR <a href=\"https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au/\">Dashboard</a>, and if\
    \ you have access to more than\none allocation, ensure that your project selector\
    \ (top left on the Dashboard, is\nset to the project of your choice).</p>\n<p>There\
    \ are a few variations of launching a VM instance from an image, here we will\n\
    navigate to images under Compute on the left hand side of the Dashboard. The Images\n\
    list displays, you will need to the Public images filter button on the top right\n\
    of the list. In the list of Public images, find the image named \u201CTPAC rstudio.xxx\
    \ yyyyy\u201D\nwhere xxx and yyyyy are mere version numbers. On the right in this\
    \ image table,\nclick the image\u2019s Launch action button. </p>\n<p><img alt=\"\

    ></p>\n<p>The Launch Instance dialog displays. </p>\n<p>On the Details tab of\
    \ the dialog, enter the instance Name, and select a Flavor\nwith a minimum of\
    \ 10GB root disk (Flavor is Nectar for size of your VM). The Image\nname \"TPAC\
    \ rstudio.xxx ...\" is already selected.</p>\n<p>On the Access &amp; Security\
    \ tab, select your key pair, and select one or more security\ngroups to apply\
    \ to your VM. To complete the instructions in this document, you will\nneed a\
    \ security group that allows SSH</p>\n<p>If you have any specific reason to run\
    \ your VM in a specific availability zone, \nyou can select it on the Availability\
    \ Zone tab. Alternatively you can let NeCTAR\ndecide where best to host your VM\
    \ by leaving the selector on \u201CAny availability zone\u201D.</p>\n<p>You don\u2019\
    t have to change anything on the \u201Cpost-Creation and Advanced Options tabs.</p>\n\
    <p>Click Launch. Launching should complete in minutes. When your instance has\n\
    successfully launched, the Dashboard will show your the IP Address of your VM.\

          \ Remote Desktop X2Go\u2019. \n What you need \n Aside from computer and\
          \ network access, you will need to be an Australian Access Federation\n\
          eligible researcher to access the NeCTAR cloud. You will also have to use\
          \ key-pair\nsecurity for your virtual machine authentication.\nUpon first\

          \ a virtual machine in NecTAR\nusing TPAC pre-build image with Matlab, X2Go\
          \ and MATE. \n \n Login to NeCTAR Dashboard with your AAF credentials. After\
          \ login,\n you should see the below screenshot: \n \n \n \n Select your\
          \ project name, click the \u2018Images\u2019 and then click tab \u2018Public\u2019\
          . It will\n show all available public images. Scroll down the list and find\

          Launch\u2019 button. You should see a pop\n up window like below: \n \n\
          \ \n \n \n In this pop up window, provide some information for the virtual\
          \ machine,\n such as name, key pair, security groups, flavour and availability\
          \ zone. Please\n note, the desktop application such as MATE requires larger\
          \ root disk size, so it\n is prefered to use flavour m2.small, m2.medium,\
          \ m2.large and m2.xlarge as these\n flavours have 30G root disk. You also\
          \ need to open port 22, as X2Go uses it for\n communication between X2Go\
          \ Server and Client. Besides, as the license requirement,\n the availability\
          \ zone is restricted to Tasmania Zone. So please make sure you launch\n\
          \ a virtual machine in the Tasmania Zone otherwise the Matlab won\u2019\
          t work properly.\n For details of how to launch a virtual machine in NeCTAR\
          \ Cloud, please refer to this link \n \n \n After clicking the \u2018Launch\u2019\
          \ button, the virtual machine will be ready in a few\n minutes. Please write\
          \ down the IP address of the newly created virtual machine as\n it will\
          \ be used later in the X2Go Client to connect to the virtual machine. \n\
          \ \n \n Note, TPAC Matlab image only works if the availability zone of the\
          \ virtual machine\nis Tasmania Zone as the Matlab uses UTAS Site License.\
          \ The Matlab will not run if\nthe availability zone is not in Tasmania.\
          \ \n Use Matlab in MATE Desktop \n To use the Matlab in the launched virtual\
          \ machine, you need to use the X20Go Client\nto connect to it.  \n Configure\
          \ the X20Go client with the information you obtained from the launched\n\
          virtual machine, such as IP address, the default user account, in this case\
          \ it\nshould be Ubuntu and the private key used  for authentication. \n\
          \ So the simple steps are: \n \n \n Configure the X20Go client to create\
          \ a session for the virtual machine \n \n \n Double Click the session and\
          \ get connection to the virtual machine \n \n \n If everything goes well,\
          \ you should see the MATE desktop \n \n \n Once you are in the MATE desktop,\
          \ click \u2018Application\u2019 menu on the top left corner\n and move mouse\
          \ cursor over the \u2018System Tools\u2019 \n \n \n A submenu will come\
          \ out and move mouse over \u2018Mate Terminal\u2019 and click \n \n \n A\
          \ terminal window will appear and type \u2018matlab\u2019 in the terminal\
          \ window \n \n \n The Matlab main window should appear \n \n \n For details\
          \ about how to connect to X2Go Server using X2Go client, please refer\n\

          \ the virtual machine will be ready in a few\n minutes. Please write down\
          \ the IP address of the newly created virtual machine as\n it will be used\
          \ later in the X2Go Client to connect to the virtual machine.</p>\n</li>\n\
          </ul>\n<p>Note, TPAC Matlab image only works if the availability zone of\
          \ the virtual machine\nis Tasmania Zone as the Matlab uses UTAS Site License.\
          \ The Matlab will not run if\nthe availability zone is not in Tasmania.</p>\n\
          <h2>Use Matlab in MATE Desktop</h2>\n<p>To use the Matlab in the launched\
          \ virtual machine, you need to use the X20Go Client\nto connect to it. </p>\n\
          <p>Configure the X20Go client with the information you obtained from the\
          \ launched\nvirtual machine, such as IP address, the default user account,\
          \ in this case it\nshould be Ubuntu and the private key used  for authentication.</p>\n\
          <p>So the simple steps are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Configure the X20Go client\
          \ to create a session for the virtual machine</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Double\
          \ Click the session and get connection to the virtual machine</p>\n</li>\n\
          <li>\n<p>If everything goes well, you should see the MATE desktop</p>\n\
          </li>\n<li>\n<p>Once you are in the MATE desktop, click \u2018Application\u2019\
          \ menu on the top left corner\n and move mouse cursor over the \u2018System\
          \ Tools\u2019</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A submenu will come out and move mouse\
          \ over \u2018Mate Terminal\u2019 and click</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A terminal\
          \ window will appear and type \u2018matlab\u2019 in the terminal window</p>\n\
          </li>\n<li>\n<p>The Matlab main window should appear</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\
          <p>For details about how to connect to X2Go Server using X2Go client, please\

        desc_un_html: " Introduction \n A remote desktop is a service that allows\
          \ a user to access and view an operating\nsystem\u2019s desktop session\
          \ that is running on another computer in another\ngeographical location.\
          \  The access occurs via the Internet or through local area\nnetwork and\
          \ enables users to  interact with at system as if they were physically\n\
          at their own computer.  \n In a remote desktop setup, the local computer\
          \ receives a copy of the desktop\nimage from the remote computer updated\
          \ regularly or when a change is detected.\nThe local computer\u2019s keyboard\
          \ and mouse inputs are transferred to the remote\ncomputer, where the remote\
          \ desktop software implements the instructions\naccordingly.  \n Protocols\
          \ for remote desktop include Remote Desktop Protocol(RDP), virtual\nnetwork\
          \ computing (VNC) and NX technology. \n Virtual machines running in the\
          \ Nectar Cloud can be accessed via a remote\ndesktop service, which allows\
          \ users to access the virtual machines through a\ndesktop GUI rather than\
          \ a traditional command line console. \n Accessing virtual machine through\
          \ a remote desktop provides many benefits over\ntraditional local computer\
          \ access: \n \n \n Allowing users to access a \u2018workplace\u2019 computer\
          \ from any location \n \n \n More computing power than is available in user\u2019\
          s local computer \n \n \n Easy to share data and to collaborate among users\
          \ \n \n \n More reliable computer system that offers 24 hours access \n\
          \ \n \n More storage options and larger disk size \n \n \n Better technical\
          \ supports as the virtual machine can be easily accessed by a\n system administrator\
          \ \n \n \n Enables running GUI applications (e.g.Matlab, R-Studio desktop\
          \ edition) in the\n Cloud  \n \n \n Multiple users can access the remote\
          \ computer at the same time \n \n \n X2Go Remote Desktop \n x2go is a free\
          \ remote desktop tool using NX technology for low latency access to\ngraphical\
          \ applications running on remote computers (such as NeCTAR virtual\nmachines).\
          \  It's much more elegant and easier to use than VNC over ssh, or\nfreeNX\
          \ or the like.  Features include: \n \n \n Simple installation \n \n \n\
          \ Client supports windows, mac and linux \n \n \n Traffic is securely tunneled\
          \ over SSH \n \n \n Very fast window redraw, low latency feedback on user\
          \ input. \n \n \n Dynamic window re-scaling (you can drag the x2go window\
          \ to resize it, and the\n remote windows resize too) \n \n \n Supports multiple\
          \ desktop environments (MAte, GNOME, KDE, etc.) \n \n \n Copy and paste\
          \ passthrough \n \n \n Sound, printing and remote file sharing (all untested\
          \ at this stage) \n \n \n X20Go Client \n The X2Go Client is the client\
          \ application that connects to a remote server and a\ndisplay a graphical\
          \ desktop on a local machine. The client requires X11 Server\ninstalled\
          \ on the local machine. On windows, the X11 Server has included in the\n\
          installation. On Linux, the client uses the local Xorg Server. On Mac, XQuartz\n\
          X11 server is required in order for the client to function. \n X2Go Server\
          \ \n The X2Go server is the server application that runs on the remote machine.\
          \ It\nstarts the application desktop sessions and transfers the desktop\
          \ to the client,\nwhich is the X20Go client.  \n For more information about\
          \ X2G0, please visit X2Go official website \n TPAC Remote Desktop Image\
          \ \n You can install X2Go server on any supported Linux distributions on\
          \ the virtual\nmachines in NecTAR Cloud and access that machines from anywhere\
          \ over a network.\nCurrently, TPAC provides a Image in NecTAR Cloud with\
          \ X2Go Server pre-installed.\nUsers can utilize this image to launch a Virtual\
          \ Machine for their applications\nrequire remote desktop. The image also\
          \ contains a GUI desktop application (Mate),\nthat provides the GUI environment\
          \ for users to images applications in Ubuntu.\nThe below lists what software\
          \ packages have been pre-installed: \n \n \n Ubuntu 14.04 (operating system)\
          \ \n \n \n X2Go Server (remote desktop server) \n \n \n Mate 1.8.1 (GUI\
          \ desktop) \n \n \n For information about how to use the X2go Client/Server\
          \ and the image, please\nrefer to the below sections. \n TPAC Remote Desktop\
          \ (X2Go) User Guide \n TPAC recommends X2Go and MATE desktop environment\
          \ for providing remote desktop\ncapability to NeCTAR virtual machines. This\
          \ guide is about how to install and\nuse three components to make an X2Go\
          \ remote desktop run in your virtual machine. \nThe GUI provider (MATE)\
          \ (on your virtual machine), the X2Go server (on your\nvirtual machine),\
          \ and the X2Go client (on your local machine). If you use one of\nthe TPAC\
          \ provided X2Go/MATE enabled images as the basis of your VM, then you\n\
          only need to ensure the you have an X2Go Client installed; the X2Go Server\
          \ and\nthe MATE GUI provider are already installed for you.  \n General\
          \ requirements: \n \n \n A supported Linux operating system on the remote\
          \ host \n \n \n Windows, OSX or Linux on the client side. \n \n \n X2Go\
          \ server installed on the remote host, no further configuration is required.\n\
          \ You can use TPAC rebuild image to launch a virtual machine as it has pre-installed\n\
          \ the X2Go Server and MATE Desktop GUI Provider. \n \n \n An account with\
          \ ssh access on the remote host (either via certificates or password) \n\
          \ \n \n X2Go client installed on the remote host and configured to talk\
          \ to the remote host \n \n \n What you need \n Aside from computer and network\
          \ access, you will need to be an Australian Access\nFederation(AAF) eligible\
          \ researcher to access the NeCTAR Cloud. The login\ncredentials are same\
          \ as your institutional credentials and if you have any\nproblems with the\
          \ AAF login, you can contact your institution help desk. You will\nalso\
          \ have to use key-pair security for your virtual machine authentication\
          \ virtual\nmachine authentication. Upon first NeCTAR Cloud use, AAF eligible\
          \ researchers are\nissued with a limited trial allocation that will do just\
          \ fine for trialling the\nTPAC Matlab in the research cloud. If you need\
          \ more resources, such as CPU, data\nstorage space, or you need it for longer\
          \ than your trial allocation, then you can\nrequest a NeCTAR allocation.\

          \ cloud\nusing the TPAC pre-build X2Go Image. For details how to launch\
          \ a virtual machine\nin NeCTAR cloud, you can refer to this link. \n \n\
          \ \n Go to NeCTAR Dashboard \n \n \n Select a project \n \n \n Click \u2018\
          Images\u2019 and in the image list find image \u2018TPAC core.001 1447714698\u2019\
          \ \n \n \n Click associated \u2018Launch\u2019 button and follow the instructions\
          \ on the pop up\n window. Provide some information for the virtual machine,\
          \ such as name, key pair,\n security groups, flavour and availability zone.\
          \ Please note, the desktop\n application such as Mate requires larger root\
          \ disk size, so it is preferred to\n use flavour m2.small, m2.medium, m2.large\
          \ and m2.xlarge as these flavours have\n 30G root disk. You also need to\
          \ open port 22, as X2Go uses it for communication\n between X2Go Server\
          \ and Client \n \n \n Click \u2018Launch\u2019 button. It might take various\
          \ minutes to launch a virtual\n machine up to the chosen availability zone.\
          \ \n \n \n Now, you should have a working X2Go server and you can use X2Go\
          \ client (refer\nto above document) to connect to it. The X2Go has a default\
          \ user account\navailable which is same as the image default account. For\
          \ Ubuntu image, the\ndefault user is ubuntu. You can find more default users\
          \ for other operating\nsystems at this link. \n Introduction to MATE Desktop\
          \ \n The TPAC pre-build X2Go image has Mate Desktop installed as its default\
          \ desktop\napplication. The MATE Desktop Environment is derived from GNOME\
          \ 2 and it provides\nan attractive and user-friendly interface for Linux.\
          \ The below note explains how\nto use the MATE interface and how to start\
          \ applications, and how to explore the\nfile system. \n For more information\
          \ about Mate Desktop, please refer to Mate Desktop official\nwebsite. \n\
          \ Elements of the MATE Desktop \n The MATE Desktop contains a link to your\
          \ home directory file browser and the Edge\nPanel on the right top corner.\
          \ The Edge Panel has a calendar, a power off button\nand a network monitor.\
          \ On the left top corner is the Applications menu, where you\ncan start\
          \ installed applications. See the below screenshot: \n \n Launching Applications\
          \ with the Application Menu \n The Applications menu is where you find and\
          \ launch applications. Move your mouse\npointer over the Application Menu\
          \ and click to open the menu. All applications\nare grouped by a name such\
          \ as Accessories and System Tools. To start an application\nsuch as \u2018\
          MATE Terminal\u2019, move mouse pointer over the group name, in this case\
          \ it\nis \u2018System Tools\u2019 and this expands the menu to contain a\
          \ sub menu. From the sub\nmenu, move mouse pointer over the \u2018MATE Terminal\u2019\
          \ and click. It is possible to\nhave have more level of sub-menus and the\
          \ launching process is the same. \n \n Managing File System \n The MATE\
          \ Desktop contains a link to your home directory and you can simply double\n\
          click that to open the file browser. You can also find the file browser\
          \ from the\n\u2018Application menu\u2019 under the \u2018System Tools\u2019\
          \ group. The menu item name is \u2018Caja\u2019. \n \n The file browser\
          \ shown above displays all files and folders under the account\nubuntu\u2019\
          s home directory. If you right click your mouse and this should bring the\n\
          context menu, see above screenshot. You can click the \u2018Empty File\u2019\
          \ menu item\nunder the \u2018Create Document\u2019 to create a new empty\
          \ file or click \u2018Create Folder\u2019\nto create a new folder. On the\
          \ left hand side has a list of folders under your\nhome folder for your\
          \ convenience. You can also click the left arrow button on the\ntoolbar\
          \ to navigate to parent folder.  \n Change System settings \n Besides the\
          \ Applications menu, there is a System menu, which you can use to\nperform\
          \ system related functions such as change the Fonts and Desktop appearances.\n\
          All these functions are under Preferences menu. \n \n Add Accounts on The\
          \ X2Go Server \n The MATE Desktop session is associated with the system\
          \ user account. By default\nin Ubuntu, this user account is ubuntu. If you\
          \ want to add more accounts to\naccess the X2Go Desktop, you can add more\
          \ system user accounts and X2Go will\nautomatically link the accounts to\
          \ the X2Go Desktop session. The below note shows\nhow to add a user account\
          \ to Ubuntu. For other operating systems, please refer to the relevant documents.\
          \ \n \n \n Open a \u2018Mate Terminal\u2019 and type \u2018sudo adduser\
          \ test\u2019 \n \n \n The console prompts a series of questions. The procedure\
          \ will be: \n \n \n Assign and confirm a password \n \n \n Enter any additional\
          \ information about the new user account \n \n \n Type \u2018Y\u2019 to\
          \ confirm and create the new user account \n \n \n You can also add user\
          \ to sudo group to give the user account sudo permission.\n Type sudo usermod\
          \ -aG sudo username \n \n \n Note, by default, user password authentication\
          \ is disabled and you need to enable\nit first before you can use password\
          \ to login. Please edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config\nfile and set keyword PasswordAuthentication\
          \ to yes to enable it. \n Now you should have a new user created. To use\
          \ this account to login to X2Go session,\nsimply create a new session in\
          \ the X2Go Client and add the new username in the Login\nfield. Once you\
          \ have created the session, you can double click the session and type\n\
          in the password. You should see the MATE desktop after that. \n Create a\
          \ Shared Data Folder on the Remote Server \n X2Go provides a feature to\
          \ allow folder on a local computer such as a Laptop to\nbe shared with the\
          \ X2Go server. That means you can easily share your data and\nfiles between\
          \ the X2Go Client and Server. The below note demonstrates how to\nenable\
          \ this feature using X2Go Windows Client. \n \n \n Double click the the\
          \ X2Go icon on the Windows Desktop \n \n \n This brings up the X2Go Client\
          \ window. Click the \u2018Session\u2019 menu and click the\n \u2018Session\
          \ management\u2018. This should bring you the screenshot like below: \n\
          \ \n \n \n \n Find the session you want to share folder with the X2Go Server\
          \ and double click\n the session name. On the pop out window, click \u2018\
          Shared folders\u2019 tab and this\n should bring you the below screenshot.\
          \ Please refer to the above document to\n find out how to create a new session\
          \ \n \n \n \n \n Click the \u2018file browser\u2019 button and in the pop\
          \ up window, select the local\n folder you want to share and click \u2018\
          Select Folder\u2019 button. \n \n \n Click the \u2018Add button\u2019 and\
          \ the folder name should be appeared in the list. Then\n tick Automount\
          \ checkbox. See below screenshot: \n \n \n \n \n \n Click \u2018Ok\u2019\
          \ button and client setup has been finished \n \n \n You can double click\
          \ the session and open a new connection to X2Go Server. On\n the MATE Desktop,\
          \ you should see a icon below the \u2018ubuntu\u2019Home\u2019 icon. Double\n\
          \ click the icon and it should open a file browser window. \n \n \n \n \n\
          \ Now, if you copy files to your shared local folder, these files will be\
          \ appeared\n on your X2Go Server as well and vice verse. \n \n Note, folder\
          \ on your local computer should has read/write permission for X2Go\nClient.\
          \ Otherwise, the shared local fold cannot be accessed by X2Go Server. \n\
          \ Upload and Download Files \n Besides the shared local folder function,\
          \ you can also use a SFTP client to upload\nand download files from the\
          \ X2Go Server. The below note shows you how to use a\nSFTP client in Windows\
          \ environment. \n \n \n Go to WinSCP official websiteto download the installer\
          \ \n \n \n Double click the downloaded executable file and follow the instructions\

          \  The access occurs via the Internet or through local area\nnetwork and\
          \ enables users to  interact with at system as if they were physically\n\
          at their own computer. </p>\n<p>In a remote desktop setup, the local computer\
          \ receives a copy of the desktop\nimage from the remote computer updated\
          \ regularly or when a change is detected.\nThe local computer\u2019s keyboard\
          \ and mouse inputs are transferred to the remote\ncomputer, where the remote\
          \ desktop software implements the instructions\naccordingly. </p>\n<p>Protocols\
          \ for remote desktop include Remote Desktop Protocol(RDP), virtual\nnetwork\
          \ computing (VNC) and NX technology.</p>\n<p>Virtual machines running in\
          \ the Nectar Cloud can be accessed via a remote\ndesktop service, which\
          \ allows users to access the virtual machines through a\ndesktop GUI rather\
          \ than a traditional command line console.</p>\n<p>Accessing virtual machine\
          \ through a remote desktop provides many benefits over\ntraditional local\
          \ computer access:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Allowing users to access a \u2018\
          workplace\u2019 computer from any location</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>More computing\
          \ power than is available in user\u2019s local computer</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\
          <p>Easy to share data and to collaborate among users</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\
          <p>More reliable computer system that offers 24 hours access</p>\n</li>\n\
          <li>\n<p>More storage options and larger disk size</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Better\
          \ technical supports as the virtual machine can be easily accessed by a\n\

          <p>Multiple users can access the remote computer at the same time</p>\n\
          </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>X2Go Remote Desktop</h2>\n<p>x2go is a free remote desktop\
          \ tool using NX technology for low latency access to\ngraphical applications\
          \ running on remote computers (such as NeCTAR virtual\nmachines).  It's\
          \ much more elegant and easier to use than VNC over ssh, or\nfreeNX or the\
          \ like.  Features include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Simple installation</p>\n\
          </li>\n<li>\n<p>Client supports windows, mac and linux</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\
          <p>Traffic is securely tunneled over SSH</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Very fast\
          \ window redraw, low latency feedback on user input.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\
          <p>Dynamic window re-scaling (you can drag the x2go window to resize it,\

          \ Client</h3>\n<p>The X2Go Client is the client application that connects\
          \ to a remote server and a\ndisplay a graphical desktop on a local machine.\
          \ The client requires X11 Server\ninstalled on the local machine. On windows,\
          \ the X11 Server has included in the\ninstallation. On Linux, the client\
          \ uses the local Xorg Server. On Mac, XQuartz\nX11 server is required in\
          \ order for the client to function.</p>\n<h3>X2Go Server</h3>\n<p>The X2Go\
          \ server is the server application that runs on the remote machine. It\n\
          starts the application desktop sessions and transfers the desktop to the\
          \ client,\nwhich is the X20Go client. </p>\n<p>For more information about\

          \ Desktop (X2Go) User Guide</h2>\n<p>TPAC recommends X2Go and MATE desktop\
          \ environment for providing remote desktop\ncapability to NeCTAR virtual\
          \ machines. This guide is about how to install and\nuse three components\
          \ to make an X2Go remote desktop run in your virtual machine. \nThe GUI\
          \ provider (MATE) (on your virtual machine), the X2Go server (on your\n\
          virtual machine), and the X2Go client (on your local machine). If you use\
          \ one of\nthe TPAC provided X2Go/MATE enabled images as the basis of your\
          \ VM, then you\nonly need to ensure the you have an X2Go Client installed;\
          \ the X2Go Server and\nthe MATE GUI provider are already installed for you.\
          \ </p>\n<p>General requirements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>A supported Linux operating\
          \ system on the remote host</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Windows, OSX or Linux on\
          \ the client side.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>X2Go server installed on the remote\

          \ security groups, flavour and availability zone. Please note, the desktop\n\
          \ application such as Mate requires larger root disk size, so it is preferred\
          \ to\n use flavour m2.small, m2.medium, m2.large and m2.xlarge as these\
          \ flavours have\n 30G root disk. You also need to open port 22, as X2Go\
          \ uses it for communication\n between X2Go Server and Client</p>\n</li>\n\
          <li>\n<p>Click \u2018Launch\u2019 button. It might take various minutes\
          \ to launch a virtual\n machine up to the chosen availability zone.</p>\n\
          </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now, you should have a working X2Go server and you can\
          \ use X2Go client (refer\nto above document) to connect to it. The X2Go\
          \ has a default user account\navailable which is same as the image default\
          \ account. For Ubuntu image, the\ndefault user is ubuntu. You can find more\
          \ default users for other operating\nsystems at this <a href=\"https://wiki.rc.nectar.org.au/wiki/Image_Catalog\"\
          >link</a>.</p>\n<h3>Introduction to MATE Desktop</h3>\n<p>The TPAC pre-build\
          \ X2Go image has Mate Desktop installed as its default desktop\napplication.\
          \ The MATE Desktop Environment is derived from GNOME 2 and it provides\n\
          an attractive and user-friendly interface for Linux. The below note explains\
          \ how\nto use the MATE interface and how to start applications, and how\
          \ to explore the\nfile system.</p>\n<p>For more information about Mate Desktop,\
          \ please refer to Mate Desktop official\n<a href=\"http://mate-desktop.org/\"\
          >website</a>.</p>\n<h4>Elements of the MATE Desktop</h4>\n<p>The MATE Desktop\
          \ contains a link to your home directory file browser and the Edge\nPanel\
          \ on the right top corner. The Edge Panel has a calendar, a power off button\n\
          and a network monitor. On the left top corner is the Applications menu,\
          \ where you\ncan start installed applications. See the below screenshot:</p>\n\
          <p><img alt=\"snapshot4\" src=\"https://github.com/NeCTAR-RC/nectarcloud-tier0doco/blob/master/articles/NeCTAR%20Documentation--DOCID16/Tools%20and%20Apps--DOCID24/images/tpac-remote-desktop-4.png?raw=true\"\

          \ mouse\npointer over the Application Menu and click to open the menu. All\
          \ applications\nare grouped by a name such as Accessories and System Tools.\
          \ To start an application\nsuch as \u2018MATE Terminal\u2019, move mouse\
          \ pointer over the group name, in this case it\nis \u2018System Tools\u2019\
          \ and this expands the menu to contain a sub menu. From the sub\nmenu, move\
          \ mouse pointer over the \u2018MATE Terminal\u2019 and click. It is possible\
          \ to\nhave have more level of sub-menus and the launching process is the\
          \ same.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"snapshot5\" src=\"https://github.com/NeCTAR-RC/nectarcloud-tier0doco/blob/master/articles/NeCTAR%20Documentation--DOCID16/Tools%20and%20Apps--DOCID24/images/tpac-remote-desktop-5.png?raw=true\"\
          ></p>\n<h4>Managing File System</h4>\n<p>The MATE Desktop contains a link\
          \ to your home directory and you can simply double\nclick that to open the\
          \ file browser. You can also find the file browser from the\n\u2018Application\
          \ menu\u2019 under the \u2018System Tools\u2019 group. The menu item name\
          \ is \u2018Caja\u2019.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"snapshot6\" src=\"https://github.com/NeCTAR-RC/nectarcloud-tier0doco/blob/master/articles/NeCTAR%20Documentation--DOCID16/Tools%20and%20Apps--DOCID24/images/tpac-remote-desktop-6.png?raw=true\"\
          ></p>\n<p>The file browser shown above displays all files and folders under\
          \ the account\nubuntu\u2019s home directory. If you right click your mouse\
          \ and this should bring the\ncontext menu, see above screenshot. You can\
          \ click the \u2018Empty File\u2019 menu item\nunder the \u2018Create Document\u2019\
          \ to create a new empty file or click \u2018Create Folder\u2019\nto create\
          \ a new folder. On the left hand side has a list of folders under your\n\
          home folder for your convenience. You can also click the left arrow button\
          \ on the\ntoolbar to navigate to parent folder. </p>\n<h4>Change System\
          \ settings</h4>\n<p>Besides the Applications menu, there is a System menu,\
          \ which you can use to\nperform system related functions such as change\
          \ the Fonts and Desktop appearances.\nAll these functions are under Preferences\
          \ menu.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"snapshot7\" src=\"https://github.com/NeCTAR-RC/nectarcloud-tier0doco/blob/master/articles/NeCTAR%20Documentation--DOCID16/Tools%20and%20Apps--DOCID24/images/tpac-remote-desktop-7.png?raw=true\"\
          ></p>\n<h3>Add Accounts on The X2Go Server</h3>\n<p>The MATE Desktop session\
          \ is associated with the system user account. By default\nin Ubuntu, this\
          \ user account is ubuntu. If you want to add more accounts to\naccess the\
          \ X2Go Desktop, you can add more system user accounts and X2Go will\nautomatically\
          \ link the accounts to the X2Go Desktop session. The below note shows\n\
          how to add a user account to Ubuntu. For other operating systems, please\
          \ refer to the relevant documents.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Open a \u2018Mate\
          \ Terminal\u2019 and type \u2018sudo adduser test\u2019</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\
          <p>The console prompts a series of questions. The procedure will be:</p>\n\
          </li>\n<li>\n<p>Assign and confirm a password</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Enter\
          \ any additional information about the new user account</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\
          <p>Type \u2018Y\u2019 to confirm and create the new user account</p>\n</li>\n\
          <li>\n<p>You can also add user to sudo group to give the user account sudo\
          \ permission.\n Type sudo usermod -aG sudo username</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\
          <p>Note, by default, user password authentication is disabled and you need\
          \ to enable\nit first before you can use password to login. Please edit\
          \ the /etc/ssh/sshd_config\nfile and set keyword PasswordAuthentication\
          \ to yes to enable it.</p>\n<p>Now you should have a new user created. To\
          \ use this account to login to X2Go session,\nsimply create a new session\
          \ in the X2Go Client and add the new username in the Login\nfield. Once\
          \ you have created the session, you can double click the session and type\n\
          in the password. You should see the MATE desktop after that.</p>\n<h3>Create\
          \ a Shared Data Folder on the Remote Server</h3>\n<p>X2Go provides a feature\
          \ to allow folder on a local computer such as a Laptop to\nbe shared with\
          \ the X2Go server. That means you can easily share your data and\nfiles\
          \ between the X2Go Client and Server. The below note demonstrates how to\n\
          enable this feature using X2Go Windows Client.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Double\
          \ click the the X2Go icon on the Windows Desktop</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This\
          \ brings up the X2Go Client window. Click the \u2018Session\u2019 menu and\

  html: "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>A remote desktop is a service that allows a user\
    \ to access and view an operating\nsystem\u2019s desktop session that is running\
    \ on another computer in another\ngeographical location.  The access occurs via\
    \ the Internet or through local area\nnetwork and enables users to  interact with\
    \ at system as if they were physically\nat their own computer. </p>\n<p>In a remote\
    \ desktop setup, the local computer receives a copy of the desktop\nimage from\
    \ the remote computer updated regularly or when a change is detected.\nThe local\
    \ computer\u2019s keyboard and mouse inputs are transferred to the remote\ncomputer,\
    \ where the remote desktop software implements the instructions\naccordingly.\
    \ </p>\n<p>Protocols for remote desktop include Remote Desktop Protocol(RDP),\
    \ virtual\nnetwork computing (VNC) and NX technology.</p>\n<p>Virtual machines\
    \ running in the Nectar Cloud can be accessed via a remote\ndesktop service, which\
    \ allows users to access the virtual machines through a\ndesktop GUI rather than\
    \ a traditional command line console.</p>\n<p>Accessing virtual machine through\
    \ a remote desktop provides many benefits over\ntraditional local computer access:</p>\n\
    <ul>\n<li>\n<p>Allowing users to access a \u2018workplace\u2019 computer from\
    \ any location</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>More computing power than is available in\
    \ user\u2019s local computer</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Easy to share data and to collaborate\
    \ among users</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>More reliable computer system that offers 24\
    \ hours access</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>More storage options and larger disk size</p>\n\
    </li>\n<li>\n<p>Better technical supports as the virtual machine can be easily\
    \ accessed by a\n system administrator</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Enables running GUI\
    \ applications (e.g.Matlab, R-Studio desktop edition) in the\n Cloud </p>\n</li>\n\
    <li>\n<p>Multiple users can access the remote computer at the same time</p>\n\
    </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>X2Go Remote Desktop</h2>\n<p>x2go is a free remote desktop tool\
    \ using NX technology for low latency access to\ngraphical applications running\
    \ on remote computers (such as NeCTAR virtual\nmachines).  It's much more elegant\
    \ and easier to use than VNC over ssh, or\nfreeNX or the like.  Features include:</p>\n\
    <ul>\n<li>\n<p>Simple installation</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Client supports windows,\
    \ mac and linux</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Traffic is securely tunneled over SSH</p>\n\
    </li>\n<li>\n<p>Very fast window redraw, low latency feedback on user input.</p>\n\
    </li>\n<li>\n<p>Dynamic window re-scaling (you can drag the x2go window to resize\
    \ it, and the\n remote windows resize too)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Supports multiple\
    \ desktop environments (MAte, GNOME, KDE, etc.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Copy and\
    \ paste passthrough</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Sound, printing and remote file sharing\
    \ (all untested at this stage)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>X20Go Client</h3>\n<p>The\
    \ X2Go Client is the client application that connects to a remote server and a\n\
    display a graphical desktop on a local machine. The client requires X11 Server\n\
    installed on the local machine. On windows, the X11 Server has included in the\n\
    installation. On Linux, the client uses the local Xorg Server. On Mac, XQuartz\n\
    X11 server is required in order for the client to function.</p>\n<h3>X2Go Server</h3>\n\
    <p>The X2Go server is the server application that runs on the remote machine.\
    \ It\nstarts the application desktop sessions and transfers the desktop to the\
    \ client,\nwhich is the X20Go client. </p>\n<p>For more information about X2G0,\
    \ please visit X2Go official <a href=\"http://wiki.x2go.org/doku.php/doc:newtox2go\"\
    >website</a></p>\n<h2>TPAC Remote Desktop Image</h2>\n<p>You can install X2Go\
    \ server on any supported Linux distributions on the virtual\nmachines in NecTAR\
    \ Cloud and access that machines from anywhere over a network.\nCurrently, TPAC\
    \ provides a Image in NecTAR Cloud with X2Go Server pre-installed.\nUsers can\
    \ utilize this image to launch a Virtual Machine for their applications\nrequire\
    \ remote desktop. The image also contains a GUI desktop application (Mate),\n\
    that provides the GUI environment for users to images applications in Ubuntu.\n\
    The below lists what software packages have been pre-installed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n\
    <p>Ubuntu 14.04 (operating system)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>X2Go Server (remote desktop\
    \ server)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Mate 1.8.1 (GUI desktop)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For\
    \ information about how to use the X2go Client/Server and the image, please\n\
    refer to the below sections.</p>\n<h2>TPAC Remote Desktop (X2Go) User Guide</h2>\n\
    <p>TPAC recommends X2Go and MATE desktop environment for providing remote desktop\n\
    capability to NeCTAR virtual machines. This guide is about how to install and\n\
    use three components to make an X2Go remote desktop run in your virtual machine.\
    \ \nThe GUI provider (MATE) (on your virtual machine), the X2Go server (on your\n\
    virtual machine), and the X2Go client (on your local machine). If you use one\
    \ of\nthe TPAC provided X2Go/MATE enabled images as the basis of your VM, then\
    \ you\nonly need to ensure the you have an X2Go Client installed; the X2Go Server\
    \ and\nthe MATE GUI provider are already installed for you. </p>\n<p>General requirements:</p>\n\
    <ul>\n<li>\n<p>A supported Linux operating system on the remote host</p>\n</li>\n\
    <li>\n<p>Windows, OSX or Linux on the client side.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>X2Go server\
    \ installed on the remote host, no further configuration is required.\n You can\
    \ use TPAC rebuild image to launch a virtual machine as it has pre-installed\n\
    \ the X2Go Server and MATE Desktop GUI Provider.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>An account\
    \ with ssh access on the remote host (either via certificates or password)</p>\n\
    </li>\n<li>\n<p>X2Go client installed on the remote host and configured to talk\
    \ to the remote host</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What you need</h3>\n<p>Aside from\
    \ computer and network access, you will need to be an Australian Access\nFederation(AAF)\
    \ eligible researcher to access the NeCTAR Cloud. The login\ncredentials are same\
    \ as your institutional credentials and if you have any\nproblems with the AAF\
    \ login, you can contact your institution help desk. You will\nalso have to use\
    \ key-pair security for your virtual machine authentication virtual\nmachine authentication.\
    \ Upon first NeCTAR Cloud use, AAF eligible researchers are\nissued with a limited\
    \ trial allocation that will do just fine for trialling the\nTPAC Matlab in the\
    \ research cloud. If you need more resources, such as CPU, data\nstorage space,\
    \ or you need it for longer than your trial allocation, then you can\nrequest\
    \ a NeCTAR allocation.</p>\n<h3>X2Go Client Installation</h3>\n<h4>X2Go Client\

    \ instructions on the pop up\n window. Provide some information for the virtual\
    \ machine, such as name, key pair,\n security groups, flavour and availability\
    \ zone. Please note, the desktop\n application such as Mate requires larger root\
    \ disk size, so it is preferred to\n use flavour m2.small, m2.medium, m2.large\
    \ and m2.xlarge as these flavours have\n 30G root disk. You also need to open\
    \ port 22, as X2Go uses it for communication\n between X2Go Server and Client</p>\n\
    </li>\n<li>\n<p>Click \u2018Launch\u2019 button. It might take various minutes\
    \ to launch a virtual\n machine up to the chosen availability zone.</p>\n</li>\n\
    </ul>\n<p>Now, you should have a working X2Go server and you can use X2Go client\
    \ (refer\nto above document) to connect to it. The X2Go has a default user account\n\
    available which is same as the image default account. For Ubuntu image, the\n\
    default user is ubuntu. You can find more default users for other operating\n\
    systems at this <a href=\"https://wiki.rc.nectar.org.au/wiki/Image_Catalog\">link</a>.</p>\n\
    <h3>Introduction to MATE Desktop</h3>\n<p>The TPAC pre-build X2Go image has Mate\
    \ Desktop installed as its default desktop\napplication. The MATE Desktop Environment\
    \ is derived from GNOME 2 and it provides\nan attractive and user-friendly interface\
    \ for Linux. The below note explains how\nto use the MATE interface and how to\
    \ start applications, and how to explore the\nfile system.</p>\n<p>For more information\
    \ about Mate Desktop, please refer to Mate Desktop official\n<a href=\"http://mate-desktop.org/\"\
    >website</a>.</p>\n<h4>Elements of the MATE Desktop</h4>\n<p>The MATE Desktop\
    \ contains a link to your home directory file browser and the Edge\nPanel on the\
    \ right top corner. The Edge Panel has a calendar, a power off button\nand a network\
    \ monitor. On the left top corner is the Applications menu, where you\ncan start\
    \ installed applications. See the below screenshot:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"snapshot4\"\

    ></p>\n<h3>Add Accounts on The X2Go Server</h3>\n<p>The MATE Desktop session is\
    \ associated with the system user account. By default\nin Ubuntu, this user account\
    \ is ubuntu. If you want to add more accounts to\naccess the X2Go Desktop, you\
    \ can add more system user accounts and X2Go will\nautomatically link the accounts\
    \ to the X2Go Desktop session. The below note shows\nhow to add a user account\
    \ to Ubuntu. For other operating systems, please refer to the relevant documents.</p>\n\
    <ul>\n<li>\n<p>Open a \u2018Mate Terminal\u2019 and type \u2018sudo adduser test\u2019\
    </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The console prompts a series of questions. The procedure\
    \ will be:</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Assign and confirm a password</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\
    <p>Enter any additional information about the new user account</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\
    <p>Type \u2018Y\u2019 to confirm and create the new user account</p>\n</li>\n\
    <li>\n<p>You can also add user to sudo group to give the user account sudo permission.\n\
    \ Type sudo usermod -aG sudo username</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note, by default,\
    \ user password authentication is disabled and you need to enable\nit first before\
    \ you can use password to login. Please edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config\nfile and\
    \ set keyword PasswordAuthentication to yes to enable it.</p>\n<p>Now you should\
    \ have a new user created. To use this account to login to X2Go session,\nsimply\
    \ create a new session in the X2Go Client and add the new username in the Login\n\
    field. Once you have created the session, you can double click the session and\
    \ type\nin the password. You should see the MATE desktop after that.</p>\n<h3>Create\
    \ a Shared Data Folder on the Remote Server</h3>\n<p>X2Go provides a feature to\
    \ allow folder on a local computer such as a Laptop to\nbe shared with the X2Go\
    \ server. That means you can easily share your data and\nfiles between the X2Go\
    \ Client and Server. The below note demonstrates how to\nenable this feature using\
    \ X2Go Windows Client.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Double click the the X2Go icon on the\

        desc_un_html: " Intersect Launchpod User Guide \n Description \n Launchpod\
          \ is a tool to deploy virtual machines (VMs) on the NeCTAR Research Cloud\
          \ with one of a number of preconfigured research-based software applications.\
          \ Launchpod is designed to work like a wizard; it will take care of the\
          \ technical aspects of spawning a VM by asking the user for the relevnt\
          \ details. The software applications that can be built using Launchpod are:\
          \ \n \n \nTwitter Scraper \u2013 a tool to harvest Twitter for hashtags,\
          \ phrases, exact tweets and specific users \n \nDIVER \u2013 a general purpose\
          \ open source research data capture and sharing application \n \nOmeka \u2013\
          \ an open source Content Management System suitable for rich collections\
          \ of data and images \n \nLimeSurvey \u2013 a tool to quickly create intuitive,\
          \ powerful, online question-and-answer surveys \n \nMATLAB\xAE \u2013 a\
          \ powerful tool for numerical computation, visualization, and programming\
          \ \n \nAlveo \u2013 a virtual laboratory of tools for searching, analysing\
          \ and annotating natural language datasets \n \nCSIRO Workspace \u2013 a\
          \ powerful software platform for sharing scientific workflows in one coherent,\
          \ simple environment \n \nRStudio \u2013 a free, powerful tool for statistical\
          \ computing and graphics. \n \n Launchpod allows researchers to quickly\
          \ establish a working version of the software without the need for specialised\
          \ IT knowledge. Also, these applications are very resource-intensive, and\
          \ running them on a notebook/desktop computer can cause the machine to run\
          \ slowly, and often the machine will need to be left on for hours in order\
          \ to complete a process. Running them in the cloud means that they are less\
          \ susceptible to crashing, and will run much faster and more efficiently\
          \ on dedicated hardware, and can be left on constantly. \n Audience \n The\
          \ typical users of Launchpod are researchers who already use these tools\
          \ on existing machines and want to use them in the cloud to improve collaboration,\
          \ or upscale their use and take advantage of the NeCTAR computing environment;\
          \ or those who want to experiment with these tools and evaluate them for\
          \ their own projects without needing to configure their own machine to run\
          \ them. \n Please note: This is a guide to using Launchpod. It is not a\
          \ guide to using the applications that can be deployed with Launchpod. Some\
          \ of the applications may require additional expertise and extensive training\
          \ in order to utilise them in your research. \n Launchpod can be accessed\
          \ by any researcher from an organisation that participates in the Australian\
          \ Access Federation (AAF). All Australian universities are members of AAF.\
          \ \n How does Launchpod work \n Launchpod uses your OpenStack API password\
          \ to access your NeCTAR account and deploy instances on your behalf. It\
          \ then runs an Ansible playbook to install the necessary software packages\
          \ and dependencies in order for the user's chosen product to be installed.\
          \ Ansible is an open-source software platform used for the automation of\
          \ software deployment using a playbook, which works like a script of actions\
          \ to be completed in order. \n The way Launchpod interacts with the NeCTAR\
          \ Research Cloud and Ansible to build the user's virtual machine complete\
          \ with their chosen software product is illustrated below. \n \n Launchpod\
          \ works as follows: \n \n The user configures their OpenStack API key in\
          \ Launchpod \n Launchpod spawns a VM in the NeCTAR Research Cloud based\
          \ on the user's entered details \n The NeCTAR Research Cloud returns the\
          \ machine's IP address on completion \n Launchpod populates an Ansible playbook\
          \ using the IP address and the user's entered details \n This Ansible playbook\
          \ is then run on the NeCTAR VM and the software packages are installed and\
          \ configured according to the user's requirements. \n \n The following sections\
          \ will cover how to obtain an OpenStack API key, what sort of configuration\
          \ options are required for spawning a virtual machine, and what sort of\
          \ configuration options are required to deploy each of the available products.\
          \ \n Obtaining an OpenStack API password \n To allow Launchpod to deploy\
          \ a VM, you must first create an OpenStack API password in your NeCTAR Dashboard.\
          \ Log in to the NeCTAR Dashboard via AAF using your institutional credentials\
          \ and go to your account settings, which are accessed by hovering the mouse\
          \ over your email address in the top-right corner of the screen.  \n \n\
          \ In Settings, select Reset Password. This will display a new API password\
          \ on the screen. Copy this password and have it ready to enter into Launchpod.\
          \ \n \n Creating or resetting the API password will not affect the way you\
          \ log into NeCTAR or any other AAF service; it is only used to allow external\
          \ services to connect to your NeCTAR account. That said, if you have other\
          \ external services that use a password to log in to your NeCTAR account,\
          \ this step will reset that password and you will have to re-authenticate\
          \ those services, or otherwise use the same password from your existing\
          \ services to authenticate Launchpod. \n Once you have your Openstack API\
          \ password, go to the Launchpod website and login using AAF. You will be\
          \ prompted to enter your OpenStack API password, which you retrieved in\
          \ the last step. Enter it here and select Change Your Password.  \n \n Launchpod\
          \ is now authorised to deploy a VM on your behalf. \n Deploying a Virtual\
          \ Machine \n Clicking Deploy New Instance will open a page where Launchpod\
          \ will ask for various configuration settings. These settings correspond\
          \ to VM deployment options within the NeCTAR Research Cloud. You are encouraged\
          \ to NeCTAR support prior to using Launchpod, to understand what these settings\
          \ refer to. \n VM Settings \n The Virtual Machine settings page asks for\
          \ the following: \n \n Product \n Project \n Flavour \n SSH Key Pair \n\
          \ Availability Zone \n Instance Name \n \n Product to be deployed (Required)\
          \ \n The product is the software application (from the list above) that\
          \ this VM will run. Selecting an application will display information about\
          \ it on the right side of the screen. You can also find more information\
          \ and links to the software website on the View Products screen. \n \n NeCTAR\
          \ project (Required) \n Launchpod deploys VMs into your existing projects.\
          \ If you have never used NeCTAR before, only your personal trial project\
          \ (beginning with pt-) will be displayed. If you are registered as a user\
          \ on any allocations, each of these will be listed and you will need to\
          \ select the appropriate one. \n Please Note: Launchpod does not have the\
          \ ability to query your project resources prior to attempting to launch\
          \ a VM. If you instruct Launchpod to deploy a VM with more resources than\
          \ you have available in your project, the deployment will fail with the\
          \ error message show below. \n \n The flavour (size) of the VM (Required)\
          \ \n Selecting a VM flavour from the drop-down list will display the flavour\
          \ technical details in the pane on the right. \n The size of the VM is limited\
          \ to the resources that are available in the project. If you select a flavour\
          \ that requires more resources than your project has available, the deployment\
          \ will fail and you will be prompted to either change project or select\
          \ a smaller flavour. \n \n SSH key pair \n The keypair is used to authenticate\
          \ to the machine via SSH (protocol to securely obtain access to a remote\
          \ computer). This drop-down list will display the keypairs that you have\
          \ in your NeCTAR account. If you have not created or uploaded a keypair\
          \ in NeCTAR and you need SSH access to this server, you should use the NeCTAR\
          \ Dashboard to create a keypair before you launch a VM with Launchpod. \n\
          \ Availability zone \n If you need the server to be deployed to a particular\
          \ node of NeCTAR, then select that node in the Availability Zone drop-down\
          \ box. If this is not important to your project, leave this blank and NeCTAR\
          \ will automatically select a node with available resources. The vast majority\
          \ of users will not need to change the availability zone of their VM. \n\
          \ Instance name \n Launchpod will set a default name for your instance,\
          \ based on the name of the software product. You may change this if you\
          \ want to, but note that the purpose of the instance name is just for identification\
          \ purposes within NeCTAR and has no effect on the VM itself. \n When you\
          \ have entered all necessary settings, click Next. \n Product-specific configurations\
          \ \n Some applications require additional settings before they can be deployed.\
          \ The following sections describe each application. \n Omeka \n Omeka needs\
          \ no additional settings, and will be launched immediately after filling\
          \ in the required NeCTAR settings and clicking Deploy. Launchpod will email\
          \ you with instructions on how to access the Omeka application once it is\
          \ deployed. \n DIVER \n DIVER requires you to specify a username and password\
          \ that you will use to log into the DIVER application. You also need to\
          \ supply an email address. Launchpod will enter the email address associated\
          \ with your AAF identity by default, but you may change this. \n Please\
          \ note: DIVER is designed for use in an ongoing, production environment\
          \ and the NeCTAR Research Cloud is not designed for this purpose. As such,\
          \ deploying an instance of DIVER via Launchpod is intended for testing/review\
          \ purposes only. Intersect can assist to implement production environments\
          \ and managed services as required. Please contact your university\u2019\
          s eResearch Analyst for more information. \n LimeSurvey \n LimeSurvey requires\
          \ you to specify a username and password that you will use to log into the\
          \ LimeSurvey application. You also need to supply an email address. Launchpod\
          \ will enter the email address associated with your AAF identity by default,\
          \ but you may change this. \n MATLAB\xAE \n MATLAB\xAE is a desktop application\
          \ and not a web application, meaning that the virtual machine needs to be\
          \ configured to allow you to log into it as if it were a desktop computer.\
          \ To deploy a MATLAB\xAE instance, you will need to configure the operating\
          \ system (OS) username and password, which will be used to log into the\
          \ machine, as well as a Virtual Network Computing (VNC) password, which\
          \ is used specifically to view the machine\u2019s desktop over the web using\
          \ a remote desktop connection and VNC software. When a MATLAB\xAE VM is\
          \ deployed, Launchpod will email you instructions on how to get VNC software\
          \ to view the machine\u2019s desktop and run MATLAB\xAE. When accessing\
          \ the machine using the VNC software, you will need to enter the VNC password\
          \ that you specified in Launchpod first, and then the OS username and password,\
          \ which you will use to log into the user account, as if you were working\
          \ on a desktop computer. \n MATLAB\xAE also requires an installation key\
          \ and a licence. An installation key is a string that informs the server\
          \ which software packages it should install. If you do not have an installation\
          \ key, your university may assist you with this. MATLAB\xAE is commercial\
          \ software and requires a licence to run. If you are a researcher at a university,\
          \ there may be an institutional licence that you can use. Contact your university\u2019\
          s IT department for assistance. Launchpod does not need the licence to deploy\
          \ a MATLAB\xAE VM and it does not ask for it, but you will need to enter\
          \ a licence in order to run the MATLAB\xAE software after the VM is deployed.\
          \ \n Alveo \n Alveo requires you to specify a username and password that\
          \ you will use to log into the Alveo application. You also need to supply\
          \ an email address. Launchpod will enter the email address associated with\
          \ your AAF identity by default, but you may change this. \n Please note:\
          \ Alveo is designed for use in an ongoing, production environment and the\
          \ NeCTAR Research Cloud is not designed for this purpose. As such, deploying\
          \ an instance of Alveo via Launchpod is intended for testing/review purposes\
          \ only. Intersect can assist to implement production environments and managed\
          \ services as required. Please contact your university\u2019s eResearch\
          \ Analyst for more information. \n Twitter Scraper \n The Twitter Scraper\
          \ is a very different tool from the rest of the applications. It does not\
          \ offer a user interface, meaning you cannot log into it, and does not allow\
          \ the user to set the search parameters once it is launched. Instead, the\
          \ search parameters are set within Launchpod, and after it is deployed it\
          \ will run continuously, generating more data until it is shut off. For\
          \ this reason, Launchpod requires you to configure the parameters during\
          \ the deployment phase. Launchpod also requires access to use your Twitter\
          \ account, much like you allowed Launchpod to interact with your NeCTAR\
          \ account. \n Please see the Twitter Scraper user guide for information\
          \ on how to deploy this tool using Launchpod. \n CSIRO Workspace \n CSIRO\
          \ Workspace is a desktop application and not a web application, meaning\
          \ that the virtual machine needs to be configured to allow you to log into\
          \ it as if it were a desktop computer. To deploy a CSIRO Workspace instance,\
          \ you will need to configure the operating system (OS) username and password,\
          \ which will be used to log into the machine, as well as a Virtual Network\
          \ Computing (VNC) password, which is used specifically to view the machine\u2019\
          s desktop over the web using a remote desktop connection and VNC software.\
          \ When the VM is deployed, Launchpod will email you instructions on how\
          \ to get VNC software to view the machine\u2019s desktop and run the software.\
          \ When accessing the machine using the VNC software, you will need to enter\
          \ the VNC password that you specified in Launchpod first, and then the OS\
          \ username and password, which you will use to log into the user account,\
          \ as if you were working on a desktop computer. \n RStudio \n RStudio is\
          \ a desktop application and not a web application, meaning that the virtual\
          \ machine needs to be configured to allow you to log into it as if it were\
          \ a desktop computer. To deploy an RStudio instance, you will need to configure\
          \ the operating system (OS) username and password, which will be used to\
          \ log into the machine, as well as a Virtual Network Computing (VNC) password,\
          \ which is used specifically to view the machine\u2019s desktop over the\
          \ web using a remote desktop connection and VNC software. When the VM is\
          \ deployed, Launchpod will email you instructions on how to get VNC software\
          \ to view the machine\u2019s desktop and run the software. When accessing\
          \ the machine using the VNC software, you will need to enter the VNC password\
          \ that you specified in Launchpod first, and then the OS username and password,\
          \ which you will use to log into the user account, as if you were working\
          \ on a desktop computer. \n Deployment \n Once you have filled in all the\
          \ necessary information that Launchpod requires for your desired application,\
          \ click Deploy. The process can take as little as two minutes or up to 40\
          \ minutes depending on the number of software packages that the machine\
          \ will have to download and install for the selected product to run properly.\
          \ When the deployment process is complete, you will receive an email with\
          \ instructions on how to access your machine. This information is also available\
          \ anytime from the Launchpod homepage via the View Instance Details link.\
          \ \n To terminate a machine, you can do so either from within the NeCTAR\
          \ Dashboard, as with any NeCTAR instance, or through the Launchpod interface\
          \ by clicking the Delete link on the homepage. \n What else do I need to\
          \ know about Launchpod \n Launchpod is simply an interface used to interact\
          \ with your NeCTAR account and, as such, you are strongly encouraged to\
          \ seek advice on using the NeCTAR Research Cloud. It is important to understand\
          \ the risks associated with cloud computing and to take any appropriate\
          \ measures to mitigate those risks such as regular backups of your data\
          \ and snapshots of your systems. We recommend you consult NeCTAR User Support\
          \ for assistance with this, or contact your university's eResearch Analyst.\
          \ \n What costs are involved \n Both Launchpod and the NeCTAR Research Cloud\
          \ are free to use for all Australian researchers.  Note that this does not\
          \ include application licensing costs where applicable (e.g. MATLAB\xAE\
          ).   "

          \ a working version of the software without the need for specialised IT\
          \ knowledge. Also, these applications are very resource-intensive, and running\
          \ them on a notebook/desktop computer can cause the machine to run slowly,\
          \ and often the machine will need to be left on for hours in order to complete\
          \ a process. Running them in the cloud means that they are less susceptible\

          \ or upscale their use and take advantage of the NeCTAR computing environment;\
          \ or those who want to experiment with these tools and evaluate them for\
          \ their own projects without needing to configure their own machine to run\
          \ them.</p>\n<p><strong>Please note:</strong> <em>This is a guide to using\
          \ Launchpod. It is not a guide to using the applications that can be deployed\
          \ with Launchpod. Some of the applications may require additional expertise\
          \ and extensive training in order to utilise them in your research.</em></p>\n\
          <p>Launchpod can be accessed by any researcher from an organisation that\
          \ participates in the Australian Access Federation (AAF). All Australian\
          \ universities are members of AAF.</p>\n<h2>How does Launchpod work</h2>\n\
          <p>Launchpod uses your OpenStack API password to access your NeCTAR account\
          \ and deploy instances on your behalf. It then runs an Ansible playbook\
          \ to install the necessary software packages and dependencies in order for\
          \ the user's chosen product to be installed. <a href=\"http://www.ansible.com/\"\
          >Ansible</a> is an open-source software platform used for the automation\
          \ of software deployment using a <em>playbook</em>, which works like a script\
          \ of actions to be completed in order.</p>\n<p>The way Launchpod interacts\
          \ with the NeCTAR Research Cloud and Ansible to build the user's virtual\
          \ machine complete with their chosen software product is illustrated below.</p>\n\
          <p><img alt=\"launchpod_workflow\" src=\"https://github.com/NeCTAR-RC/nectarcloud-tier0doco/blob/master/articles/NeCTAR%20Documentation--DOCID16/Tools%20and%20Apps--DOCID24/images/launchpod-launchpod-workflow.png?raw=true\"\
          \ title=\"Launchpod Workflow\"></p>\n<p>Launchpod works as follows:</p>\n\
          <ol>\n<li>The user configures their OpenStack API key in Launchpod</li>\n\
          <li>Launchpod spawns a VM in the NeCTAR Research Cloud based on the user's\
          \ entered details</li>\n<li>The NeCTAR Research Cloud returns the machine's\
          \ IP address on completion</li>\n<li>Launchpod populates an Ansible playbook\
          \ using the IP address and the user's entered details</li>\n<li>This Ansible\
          \ playbook is then run on the NeCTAR VM and the software packages are installed\
          \ and configured according to the user's requirements.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The\
          \ following sections will cover how to obtain an OpenStack API key, what\
          \ sort of configuration options are required for spawning a virtual machine,\
          \ and what sort of configuration options are required to deploy each of\
          \ the available products.</p>\n<h3>Obtaining an OpenStack API password</h3>\n\
          <p>To allow Launchpod to deploy a VM, you must first create an OpenStack\
          \ API password in your NeCTAR Dashboard. Log in to the <a href=\"http://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au/\"\
          >NeCTAR Dashboard</a> via AAF using your institutional credentials and go\
          \ to your account settings, which are accessed by hovering the mouse over\
          \ your email address in the top-right corner of the screen. </p>\n<p><img\
          \ alt=\"nectar-settings\" src=\"https://github.com/NeCTAR-RC/nectarcloud-tier0doco/blob/master/articles/NeCTAR%20Documentation--DOCID16/Tools%20and%20Apps--DOCID24/images/launchpod-user-settings.png?raw=true\"\
          \ title=\"NeCTAR User Settings\"></p>\n<p>In Settings, select <em>Reset\
          \ Password</em>. This will display a new API password on the screen. Copy\
          \ this password and have it ready to enter into Launchpod.</p>\n<p><img\
          \ alt=\"reset-password\" src=\"https://github.com/NeCTAR-RC/nectarcloud-tier0doco/blob/master/articles/NeCTAR%20Documentation--DOCID16/Tools%20and%20Apps--DOCID24/images/launchpod-reset-password.png?raw=true\"\
          \ title=\"Reset Password\"></p>\n<p>Creating or resetting the API password\
          \ will not affect the way you log into NeCTAR or any other AAF service;\
          \ it is only used to allow external services to connect to your NeCTAR account.\
          \ That said, if you have other external services that use a password to\
          \ log in to your NeCTAR account, this step will reset that password and\
          \ you will have to re-authenticate those services, or otherwise use the\
          \ same password from your existing services to authenticate Launchpod.</p>\n\
          <p>Once you have your Openstack API password, go to the Launchpod website\
          \ and login using AAF. You will be prompted to enter your OpenStack API\
          \ password, which you retrieved in the last step. Enter it here and select\
          \ <em>Change Your Password</em>. </p>\n<p><img alt=\"change-password\" src=\"\
          https://github.com/NeCTAR-RC/nectarcloud-tier0doco/blob/master/articles/NeCTAR%20Documentation--DOCID16/Tools%20and%20Apps--DOCID24/images/launchpod-change-password.png?raw=true\"\
          \ title=\"Change Password\"></p>\n<p>Launchpod is now authorised to deploy\
          \ a VM on your behalf.</p>\n<h3>Deploying a Virtual Machine</h3>\n<p>Clicking\
          \ <em>Deploy New Instance</em> will open a page where Launchpod will ask\
          \ for various configuration settings. These settings correspond to VM deployment\
          \ options within the NeCTAR Research Cloud. You are encouraged to NeCTAR\
          \ support prior to using Launchpod, to understand what these settings refer\
          \ to.</p>\n<h4>VM Settings</h4>\n<p>The Virtual Machine settings page asks\
          \ for the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Product</li>\n<li>Project</li>\n<li>Flavour</li>\n\
          <li>SSH Key Pair</li>\n<li>Availability Zone</li>\n<li>Instance Name</li>\n\
          </ul>\n<h5>Product to be deployed (Required)</h5>\n<p>The <em>product</em>\
          \ is the software application (from the list above) that this VM will run.\
          \ Selecting an application will display information about it on the right\
          \ side of the screen. You can also find more information and links to the\
          \ software website on the <em>View Products</em> screen.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\
          product-details\" src=\"https://github.com/NeCTAR-RC/nectarcloud-tier0doco/blob/master/articles/NeCTAR%20Documentation--DOCID16/Tools%20and%20Apps--DOCID24/images/launchpod-product-details.png?raw=true\"\
          \ title=\"Product Details\"></p>\n<h5>NeCTAR project (Required)</h5>\n<p>Launchpod\
          \ deploys VMs into your existing projects. If you have never used NeCTAR\
          \ before, only your personal trial project (beginning with <em>pt-</em>)\
          \ will be displayed. If you are registered as a user on any allocations,\
          \ each of these will be listed and you will need to select the appropriate\
          \ one.</p>\n<p><strong>Please Note</strong>: <em>Launchpod does not have\
          \ the ability to query your project resources prior to attempting to launch\
          \ a VM. If you instruct Launchpod to deploy a VM with more resources than\
          \ you have available in your project, the deployment will fail with the\
          \ error message show below.</em></p>\n<p><img alt=\"insufficient-resources\"\
          \ src=\"https://github.com/NeCTAR-RC/nectarcloud-tier0doco/blob/master/articles/NeCTAR%20Documentation--DOCID16/Tools%20and%20Apps--DOCID24/images/launchpod-insufficient-resources.png?raw=true\"\
          \ title=\"Insufficient Resources\"></p>\n<h5>The <em>flavour</em> (size)\
          \ of the VM (Required)</h5>\n<p>Selecting a VM flavour from the drop-down\
          \ list will display the flavour technical details in the pane on the right.</p>\n\
          <p>The size of the VM is limited to the resources that are available in\
          \ the project. If you select a flavour that requires more resources than\
          \ your project has available, the deployment will fail and you will be prompted\
          \ to either change project or select a smaller flavour.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\
          flavour\" src=\"https://github.com/NeCTAR-RC/nectarcloud-tier0doco/blob/master/articles/NeCTAR%20Documentation--DOCID16/Tools%20and%20Apps--DOCID24/images/launchpod-flavour.png?raw=true\"\
          \ title=\"Flavour\"></p>\n<h5>SSH key pair</h5>\n<p>The keypair is used\
          \ to authenticate to the machine via SSH (protocol to securely obtain access\
          \ to a remote computer). This drop-down list will display the keypairs that\
          \ you have in your NeCTAR account. If you have not created or uploaded a\
          \ keypair in NeCTAR and you need SSH access to this server, you should use\
          \ the NeCTAR Dashboard to create a keypair before you launch a VM with Launchpod.</p>\n\
          <h5>Availability zone</h5>\n<p>If you need the server to be deployed to\
          \ a particular node of NeCTAR, then select that node in the <em>Availability\
          \ Zone</em> drop-down box. If this is not important to your project, leave\
          \ this blank and NeCTAR will automatically select a node with available\
          \ resources. The vast majority of users will not need to change the availability\
          \ zone of their VM.</p>\n<h5>Instance name</h5>\n<p>Launchpod will set a\
          \ default name for your instance, based on the name of the software product.\
          \ You may change this if you want to, but note that the purpose of the instance\
          \ name is just for identification purposes within NeCTAR and has no effect\
          \ on the VM itself.</p>\n<p>When you have entered all necessary settings,\
          \ click <em>Next</em>.</p>\n<h4>Product-specific configurations</h4>\n<p>Some\
          \ applications require additional settings before they can be deployed.\
          \ The following sections describe each application.</p>\n<h5>Omeka</h5>\n\
          <p>Omeka needs no additional settings, and will be launched immediately\
          \ after filling in the required NeCTAR settings and clicking <em>Deploy</em>.\
          \ Launchpod will email you with instructions on how to access the Omeka\
          \ application once it is deployed.</p>\n<h5>DIVER</h5>\n<p>DIVER requires\
          \ you to specify a username and password that you will use to log into the\
          \ DIVER application. You also need to supply an email address. Launchpod\
          \ will enter the email address associated with your AAF identity by default,\
          \ but you may change this.</p>\n<p><strong>Please note:</strong> <em>DIVER\
          \ is designed for use in an ongoing, production environment and the NeCTAR\
          \ Research Cloud is not designed for this purpose. As such, deploying an\
          \ instance of DIVER via Launchpod is intended for testing/review purposes\
          \ only. Intersect can assist to implement production environments and managed\
          \ services as required. Please contact your university\u2019s <a href=\"\
          http://intersect.org.au/content/eresearch-analysts\">eResearch Analyst</a>\
          \ for more information.</em></p>\n<h5>LimeSurvey</h5>\n<p>LimeSurvey requires\
          \ you to specify a username and password that you will use to log into the\
          \ LimeSurvey application. You also need to supply an email address. Launchpod\
          \ will enter the email address associated with your AAF identity by default,\
          \ but you may change this.</p>\n<h5>MATLAB\xAE</h5>\n<p>MATLAB\xAE is a\
          \ desktop application and not a web application, meaning that the virtual\
          \ machine needs to be configured to allow you to log into it as if it were\
          \ a desktop computer. To deploy a MATLAB\xAE instance, you will need to\
          \ configure the operating system (OS) username and password, which will\
          \ be used to log into the machine, as well as a Virtual Network Computing\
          \ (VNC) password, which is used specifically to view the machine\u2019s\
          \ desktop over the web using a remote desktop connection and VNC software.\
          \ When a MATLAB\xAE VM is deployed, Launchpod will email you instructions\
          \ on how to get VNC software to view the machine\u2019s desktop and run\
          \ MATLAB\xAE. When accessing the machine using the VNC software, you will\
          \ need to enter the VNC password that you specified in Launchpod first,\
          \ and then the OS username and password, which you will use to log into\
          \ the user account, as if you were working on a desktop computer.</p>\n\
          <p>MATLAB\xAE also requires an installation key and a licence. An installation\
          \ key is a string that informs the server which software packages it should\
          \ install. If you do not have an installation key, your university may assist\
          \ you with this. MATLAB\xAE is commercial software and requires a licence\
          \ to run. If you are a researcher at a university, there may be an institutional\
          \ licence that you can use. Contact your university\u2019s IT department\
          \ for assistance. Launchpod does not need the licence to deploy a MATLAB\xAE\
          \ VM and it does not ask for it, but you will need to enter a licence in\
          \ order to run the MATLAB\xAE software after the VM is deployed.</p>\n<h5>Alveo</h5>\n\
          <p>Alveo requires you to specify a username and password that you will use\
          \ to log into the Alveo application. You also need to supply an email address.\
          \ Launchpod will enter the email address associated with your AAF identity\
          \ by default, but you may change this.</p>\n<p><strong>Please note:</strong>\
          \ <em>Alveo is designed for use in an ongoing, production environment and\
          \ the NeCTAR Research Cloud is not designed for this purpose. As such, deploying\
          \ an instance of Alveo via Launchpod is intended for testing/review purposes\

          \ for more information.</em></p>\n<h5>Twitter Scraper</h5>\n<p>The Twitter\
          \ Scraper is a very different tool from the rest of the applications. It\
          \ does not offer a user interface, meaning you cannot log into it, and does\
          \ not allow the user to set the search parameters once it is launched. Instead,\
          \ the search parameters are set within Launchpod, and after it is deployed\
          \ it will run continuously, generating more data until it is shut off. For\
          \ this reason, Launchpod requires you to configure the parameters during\
          \ the deployment phase. Launchpod also requires access to use your Twitter\
          \ account, much like you allowed Launchpod to interact with your NeCTAR\
          \ account.</p>\n<p>Please see the <a href=\"https://support.nectar.org.au/support/solutions/articles/6000089738-intersect-twitter-scraper-user-guide\"\
          >Twitter Scraper user guide</a> for information on how to deploy this tool\
          \ using Launchpod.</p>\n<h5>CSIRO Workspace</h5>\n<p>CSIRO Workspace is\
          \ a desktop application and not a web application, meaning that the virtual\
          \ machine needs to be configured to allow you to log into it as if it were\
          \ a desktop computer. To deploy a CSIRO Workspace instance, you will need\
          \ to configure the operating system (OS) username and password, which will\
          \ be used to log into the machine, as well as a Virtual Network Computing\
          \ (VNC) password, which is used specifically to view the machine\u2019s\
          \ desktop over the web using a remote desktop connection and VNC software.\
          \ When the VM is deployed, Launchpod will email you instructions on how\
          \ to get VNC software to view the machine\u2019s desktop and run the software.\
          \ When accessing the machine using the VNC software, you will need to enter\
          \ the VNC password that you specified in Launchpod first, and then the OS\
          \ username and password, which you will use to log into the user account,\
          \ as if you were working on a desktop computer.</p>\n<h5>RStudio</h5>\n\
          <p>RStudio is a desktop application and not a web application, meaning that\
          \ the virtual machine needs to be configured to allow you to log into it\
          \ as if it were a desktop computer. To deploy an RStudio instance, you will\
          \ need to configure the operating system (OS) username and password, which\
          \ will be used to log into the machine, as well as a Virtual Network Computing\
          \ (VNC) password, which is used specifically to view the machine\u2019s\
          \ desktop over the web using a remote desktop connection and VNC software.\
          \ When the VM is deployed, Launchpod will email you instructions on how\
          \ to get VNC software to view the machine\u2019s desktop and run the software.\
          \ When accessing the machine using the VNC software, you will need to enter\
          \ the VNC password that you specified in Launchpod first, and then the OS\
          \ username and password, which you will use to log into the user account,\
          \ as if you were working on a desktop computer.</p>\n<h3>Deployment</h3>\n\
          <p>Once you have filled in all the necessary information that Launchpod\
          \ requires for your desired application, click <em>Deploy</em>. The process\
          \ can take as little as two minutes or up to 40 minutes depending on the\
          \ number of software packages that the machine will have to download and\
          \ install for the selected product to run properly. When the deployment\
          \ process is complete, you will receive an email with instructions on how\
          \ to access your machine. This information is also available anytime from\
          \ the Launchpod homepage via the <em>View Instance Details</em> link.</p>\n\
          <p>To terminate a machine, you can do so either from within the NeCTAR Dashboard,\
          \ as with any NeCTAR instance, or through the Launchpod interface by clicking\
          \ the <em>Delete</em> link on the homepage.</p>\n<h2>What else do I need\
          \ to know about Launchpod</h2>\n<p>Launchpod is simply an interface used\
          \ to interact with your NeCTAR account and, as such, you are strongly encouraged\
          \ to seek advice on using the NeCTAR Research Cloud. It is important to\
          \ understand the risks associated with cloud computing and to take any appropriate\
          \ measures to mitigate those risks such as regular backups of your data\
          \ and snapshots of your systems. We recommend you consult NeCTAR User Support\
          \ for assistance with this, or contact your university's <a href=\"http://intersect.org.au/content/eresearch-analysts\"\
          >eResearch Analyst</a>.</p>\n<h2>What costs are involved</h2>\n<p>Both Launchpod\
          \ and the NeCTAR Research Cloud are free to use for all Australian researchers.\
          \  Note that this does not include application licensing costs where applicable\
          \ (e.g. MATLAB\xAE).  </p>"

    </ul>\n<p>Launchpod allows researchers to quickly establish a working version\
    \ of the software without the need for specialised IT knowledge. Also, these applications\
    \ are very resource-intensive, and running them on a notebook/desktop computer\
    \ can cause the machine to run slowly, and often the machine will need to be left\
    \ on for hours in order to complete a process. Running them in the cloud means\
    \ that they are less susceptible to crashing, and will run much faster and more\
    \ efficiently on dedicated hardware, and can be left on constantly.</p>\n<h2>Audience</h2>\n\
    <p>The typical users of Launchpod are researchers who already use these tools\
    \ on existing machines and want to use them in the cloud to improve collaboration,\
    \ or upscale their use and take advantage of the NeCTAR computing environment;\
    \ or those who want to experiment with these tools and evaluate them for their\
    \ own projects without needing to configure their own machine to run them.</p>\n\
    <p><strong>Please note:</strong> <em>This is a guide to using Launchpod. It is\
    \ not a guide to using the applications that can be deployed with Launchpod. Some\
    \ of the applications may require additional expertise and extensive training\
    \ in order to utilise them in your research.</em></p>\n<p>Launchpod can be accessed\
    \ by any researcher from an organisation that participates in the Australian Access\
    \ Federation (AAF). All Australian universities are members of AAF.</p>\n<h2>How\
    \ does Launchpod work</h2>\n<p>Launchpod uses your OpenStack API password to access\
    \ your NeCTAR account and deploy instances on your behalf. It then runs an Ansible\
    \ playbook to install the necessary software packages and dependencies in order\
    \ for the user's chosen product to be installed. <a href=\"http://www.ansible.com/\"\
    >Ansible</a> is an open-source software platform used for the automation of software\
    \ deployment using a <em>playbook</em>, which works like a script of actions to\
    \ be completed in order.</p>\n<p>The way Launchpod interacts with the NeCTAR Research\
    \ Cloud and Ansible to build the user's virtual machine complete with their chosen\
    \ software product is illustrated below.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"launchpod_workflow\"\

    \ Documentation--DOCID16/Tools and Apps--DOCID24/images/launchpod-launchpod-workflow.png?raw=true\"\
    \ title=\"Launchpod Workflow\"></p>\n<p>Launchpod works as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n\
    <li>The user configures their OpenStack API key in Launchpod</li>\n<li>Launchpod\
    \ spawns a VM in the NeCTAR Research Cloud based on the user's entered details</li>\n\
    <li>The NeCTAR Research Cloud returns the machine's IP address on completion</li>\n\
    <li>Launchpod populates an Ansible playbook using the IP address and the user's\
    \ entered details</li>\n<li>This Ansible playbook is then run on the NeCTAR VM\
    \ and the software packages are installed and configured according to the user's\
    \ requirements.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The following sections will cover how to obtain\
    \ an OpenStack API key, what sort of configuration options are required for spawning\
    \ a virtual machine, and what sort of configuration options are required to deploy\
    \ each of the available products.</p>\n<h3>Obtaining an OpenStack API password</h3>\n\
    <p>To allow Launchpod to deploy a VM, you must first create an OpenStack API password\
    \ in your NeCTAR Dashboard. Log in to the <a href=\"http://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au/\"\
    >NeCTAR Dashboard</a> via AAF using your institutional credentials and go to your\
    \ account settings, which are accessed by hovering the mouse over your email address\
    \ in the top-right corner of the screen. </p>\n<p><img alt=\"nectar-settings\"\

    \ Documentation--DOCID16/Tools and Apps--DOCID24/images/launchpod-reset-password.png?raw=true\"\
    \ title=\"Reset Password\"></p>\n<p>Creating or resetting the API password will\
    \ not affect the way you log into NeCTAR or any other AAF service; it is only\
    \ used to allow external services to connect to your NeCTAR account. That said,\
    \ if you have other external services that use a password to log in to your NeCTAR\
    \ account, this step will reset that password and you will have to re-authenticate\
    \ those services, or otherwise use the same password from your existing services\
    \ to authenticate Launchpod.</p>\n<p>Once you have your Openstack API password,\
    \ go to the Launchpod website and login using AAF. You will be prompted to enter\
    \ your OpenStack API password, which you retrieved in the last step. Enter it\
    \ here and select <em>Change Your Password</em>. </p>\n<p><img alt=\"change-password\"\

    \ title=\"Change Password\"></p>\n<p>Launchpod is now authorised to deploy a VM\
    \ on your behalf.</p>\n<h3>Deploying a Virtual Machine</h3>\n<p>Clicking <em>Deploy\
    \ New Instance</em> will open a page where Launchpod will ask for various configuration\
    \ settings. These settings correspond to VM deployment options within the NeCTAR\
    \ Research Cloud. You are encouraged to NeCTAR support prior to using Launchpod,\
    \ to understand what these settings refer to.</p>\n<h4>VM Settings</h4>\n<p>The\
    \ Virtual Machine settings page asks for the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Product</li>\n\
    <li>Project</li>\n<li>Flavour</li>\n<li>SSH Key Pair</li>\n<li>Availability Zone</li>\n\
    <li>Instance Name</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Product to be deployed (Required)</h5>\n<p>The\
    \ <em>product</em> is the software application (from the list above) that this\
    \ VM will run. Selecting an application will display information about it on the\
    \ right side of the screen. You can also find more information and links to the\
    \ software website on the <em>View Products</em> screen.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"product-details\"\

    \ title=\"Product Details\"></p>\n<h5>NeCTAR project (Required)</h5>\n<p>Launchpod\
    \ deploys VMs into your existing projects. If you have never used NeCTAR before,\
    \ only your personal trial project (beginning with <em>pt-</em>) will be displayed.\
    \ If you are registered as a user on any allocations, each of these will be listed\
    \ and you will need to select the appropriate one.</p>\n<p><strong>Please Note</strong>:\
    \ <em>Launchpod does not have the ability to query your project resources prior\
    \ to attempting to launch a VM. If you instruct Launchpod to deploy a VM with\
    \ more resources than you have available in your project, the deployment will\
    \ fail with the error message show below.</em></p>\n<p><img alt=\"insufficient-resources\"\

    \ title=\"Insufficient Resources\"></p>\n<h5>The <em>flavour</em> (size) of the\
    \ VM (Required)</h5>\n<p>Selecting a VM flavour from the drop-down list will display\
    \ the flavour technical details in the pane on the right.</p>\n<p>The size of\
    \ the VM is limited to the resources that are available in the project. If you\
    \ select a flavour that requires more resources than your project has available,\
    \ the deployment will fail and you will be prompted to either change project or\
    \ select a smaller flavour.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"flavour\" src=\"https://github.com/NeCTAR-RC/nectarcloud-tier0doco/blob/master/articles/NeCTAR\
    \ Documentation--DOCID16/Tools and Apps--DOCID24/images/launchpod-flavour.png?raw=true\"\
    \ title=\"Flavour\"></p>\n<h5>SSH key pair</h5>\n<p>The keypair is used to authenticate\
    \ to the machine via SSH (protocol to securely obtain access to a remote computer).\
    \ This drop-down list will display the keypairs that you have in your NeCTAR account.\
    \ If you have not created or uploaded a keypair in NeCTAR and you need SSH access\
    \ to this server, you should use the NeCTAR Dashboard to create a keypair before\
    \ you launch a VM with Launchpod.</p>\n<h5>Availability zone</h5>\n<p>If you need\
    \ the server to be deployed to a particular node of NeCTAR, then select that node\
    \ in the <em>Availability Zone</em> drop-down box. If this is not important to\
    \ your project, leave this blank and NeCTAR will automatically select a node with\
    \ available resources. The vast majority of users will not need to change the\
    \ availability zone of their VM.</p>\n<h5>Instance name</h5>\n<p>Launchpod will\
    \ set a default name for your instance, based on the name of the software product.\
    \ You may change this if you want to, but note that the purpose of the instance\
    \ name is just for identification purposes within NeCTAR and has no effect on\
    \ the VM itself.</p>\n<p>When you have entered all necessary settings, click <em>Next</em>.</p>\n\
    <h4>Product-specific configurations</h4>\n<p>Some applications require additional\
    \ settings before they can be deployed. The following sections describe each application.</p>\n\
    <h5>Omeka</h5>\n<p>Omeka needs no additional settings, and will be launched immediately\
    \ after filling in the required NeCTAR settings and clicking <em>Deploy</em>.\
    \ Launchpod will email you with instructions on how to access the Omeka application\
    \ once it is deployed.</p>\n<h5>DIVER</h5>\n<p>DIVER requires you to specify a\
    \ username and password that you will use to log into the DIVER application. You\
    \ also need to supply an email address. Launchpod will enter the email address\
    \ associated with your AAF identity by default, but you may change this.</p>\n\
    <p><strong>Please note:</strong> <em>DIVER is designed for use in an ongoing,\
    \ production environment and the NeCTAR Research Cloud is not designed for this\
    \ purpose. As such, deploying an instance of DIVER via Launchpod is intended for\
    \ testing/review purposes only. Intersect can assist to implement production environments\
    \ and managed services as required. Please contact your university\u2019s <a href=\"\
    http://intersect.org.au/content/eresearch-analysts\">eResearch Analyst</a> for\
    \ more information.</em></p>\n<h5>LimeSurvey</h5>\n<p>LimeSurvey requires you\
    \ to specify a username and password that you will use to log into the LimeSurvey\
    \ application. You also need to supply an email address. Launchpod will enter\
    \ the email address associated with your AAF identity by default, but you may\
    \ change this.</p>\n<h5>MATLAB\xAE</h5>\n<p>MATLAB\xAE is a desktop application\
    \ and not a web application, meaning that the virtual machine needs to be configured\
    \ to allow you to log into it as if it were a desktop computer. To deploy a MATLAB\xAE\
    \ instance, you will need to configure the operating system (OS) username and\
    \ password, which will be used to log into the machine, as well as a Virtual Network\
    \ Computing (VNC) password, which is used specifically to view the machine\u2019\
    s desktop over the web using a remote desktop connection and VNC software. When\
    \ a MATLAB\xAE VM is deployed, Launchpod will email you instructions on how to\
    \ get VNC software to view the machine\u2019s desktop and run MATLAB\xAE. When\
    \ accessing the machine using the VNC software, you will need to enter the VNC\
    \ password that you specified in Launchpod first, and then the OS username and\
    \ password, which you will use to log into the user account, as if you were working\
    \ on a desktop computer.</p>\n<p>MATLAB\xAE also requires an installation key\
    \ and a licence. An installation key is a string that informs the server which\
    \ software packages it should install. If you do not have an installation key,\
    \ your university may assist you with this. MATLAB\xAE is commercial software\
    \ and requires a licence to run. If you are a researcher at a university, there\
    \ may be an institutional licence that you can use. Contact your university\u2019\
    s IT department for assistance. Launchpod does not need the licence to deploy\
    \ a MATLAB\xAE VM and it does not ask for it, but you will need to enter a licence\
    \ in order to run the MATLAB\xAE software after the VM is deployed.</p>\n<h5>Alveo</h5>\n\
    <p>Alveo requires you to specify a username and password that you will use to\
    \ log into the Alveo application. You also need to supply an email address. Launchpod\
    \ will enter the email address associated with your AAF identity by default, but\
    \ you may change this.</p>\n<p><strong>Please note:</strong> <em>Alveo is designed\
    \ for use in an ongoing, production environment and the NeCTAR Research Cloud\
    \ is not designed for this purpose. As such, deploying an instance of Alveo via\
    \ Launchpod is intended for testing/review purposes only. Intersect can assist\
    \ to implement production environments and managed services as required. Please\
    \ contact your university\u2019s <a href=\"http://intersect.org.au/content/eresearch-analysts\"\
    >eResearch Analyst</a> for more information.</em></p>\n<h5>Twitter Scraper</h5>\n\
    <p>The Twitter Scraper is a very different tool from the rest of the applications.\
    \ It does not offer a user interface, meaning you cannot log into it, and does\
    \ not allow the user to set the search parameters once it is launched. Instead,\
    \ the search parameters are set within Launchpod, and after it is deployed it\
    \ will run continuously, generating more data until it is shut off. For this reason,\
    \ Launchpod requires you to configure the parameters during the deployment phase.\
    \ Launchpod also requires access to use your Twitter account, much like you allowed\
    \ Launchpod to interact with your NeCTAR account.</p>\n<p>Please see the <a href=\"\
    https://support.nectar.org.au/support/solutions/articles/6000089738-intersect-twitter-scraper-user-guide\"\
    >Twitter Scraper user guide</a> for information on how to deploy this tool using\
    \ Launchpod.</p>\n<h5>CSIRO Workspace</h5>\n<p>CSIRO Workspace is a desktop application\
    \ and not a web application, meaning that the virtual machine needs to be configured\
    \ to allow you to log into it as if it were a desktop computer. To deploy a CSIRO\
    \ Workspace instance, you will need to configure the operating system (OS) username\
    \ and password, which will be used to log into the machine, as well as a Virtual\
    \ Network Computing (VNC) password, which is used specifically to view the machine\u2019\
    s desktop over the web using a remote desktop connection and VNC software. When\
    \ the VM is deployed, Launchpod will email you instructions on how to get VNC\
    \ software to view the machine\u2019s desktop and run the software. When accessing\
    \ the machine using the VNC software, you will need to enter the VNC password\
    \ that you specified in Launchpod first, and then the OS username and password,\
    \ which you will use to log into the user account, as if you were working on a\
    \ desktop computer.</p>\n<h5>RStudio</h5>\n<p>RStudio is a desktop application\
    \ and not a web application, meaning that the virtual machine needs to be configured\
    \ to allow you to log into it as if it were a desktop computer. To deploy an RStudio\
    \ instance, you will need to configure the operating system (OS) username and\
    \ password, which will be used to log into the machine, as well as a Virtual Network\
    \ Computing (VNC) password, which is used specifically to view the machine\u2019\
    s desktop over the web using a remote desktop connection and VNC software. When\
    \ the VM is deployed, Launchpod will email you instructions on how to get VNC\
    \ software to view the machine\u2019s desktop and run the software. When accessing\
    \ the machine using the VNC software, you will need to enter the VNC password\
    \ that you specified in Launchpod first, and then the OS username and password,\
    \ which you will use to log into the user account, as if you were working on a\
    \ desktop computer.</p>\n<h3>Deployment</h3>\n<p>Once you have filled in all the\
    \ necessary information that Launchpod requires for your desired application,\
    \ click <em>Deploy</em>. The process can take as little as two minutes or up to\
    \ 40 minutes depending on the number of software packages that the machine will\
    \ have to download and install for the selected product to run properly. When\
    \ the deployment process is complete, you will receive an email with instructions\
    \ on how to access your machine. This information is also available anytime from\
    \ the Launchpod homepage via the <em>View Instance Details</em> link.</p>\n<p>To\
    \ terminate a machine, you can do so either from within the NeCTAR Dashboard,\
    \ as with any NeCTAR instance, or through the Launchpod interface by clicking\
    \ the <em>Delete</em> link on the homepage.</p>\n<h2>What else do I need to know\
    \ about Launchpod</h2>\n<p>Launchpod is simply an interface used to interact with\
    \ your NeCTAR account and, as such, you are strongly encouraged to seek advice\
    \ on using the NeCTAR Research Cloud. It is important to understand the risks\
    \ associated with cloud computing and to take any appropriate measures to mitigate\
    \ those risks such as regular backups of your data and snapshots of your systems.\
    \ We recommend you consult NeCTAR User Support for assistance with this, or contact\
    \ your university's <a href=\"http://intersect.org.au/content/eresearch-analysts\"\
    >eResearch Analyst</a>.</p>\n<h2>What costs are involved</h2>\n<p>Both Launchpod\
    \ and the NeCTAR Research Cloud are free to use for all Australian researchers.\
    \  Note that this does not include application licensing costs where applicable\
    \ (e.g. MATLAB\xAE).  </p>"

    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>DIVER (Data Is Vital for Empirical Research) is a general purpose, user-friendly
    research data capture and sharing application.</p>

    <p>DIVER is a full lifecycle research data management solution, developed by Intersect
    for the University of Western Sydney Hawkesbury Institute for the Environment
    (HIE). </p>

    <p>DIVER is particularly beneficial where the researcher needs to quickly organize
    and share their file-based data locally or with an international community. DIVER
    provides functionality beyond traditional organisational file shares addressing
    contemporary research needs such as data provenance and lifecycle management,
    data access management, management of metadata, data citation and reproducibility
    of research.</p>

    <h2>Audience</h2>

    <p>DIVER is Open Source software and as such is available to all researchers at
    no cost.</p>

    <p>Intersect Australia has experience in assisting researchers/research groups
    to establish a DIVER instance through its Software Engineering capability. Hosted
    solutions may also be managed by Intersect where required. </p>

    <h2>How to deploy DIVER</h2>

    <p>The latest version of DIVER is available through <a href="http://launchpod.intersect.org.au"
    title="Launchpod">Launchpod</a>, a tool to deploy preconfigured virtual machines
    (VMs) on the <a href="http://cloud.nectar.org.au/" title="NeCTAR Research Cloud">NeCTAR
    Research Cloud</a>. Please read the <a href="http://intersect.org.au/content/launchpod"
    title="Launchpod user guide">Launchpod user guide</a> for more information about
    how to use it to deploy an instance of DIVER.</p>

    <p>For more detailed discussion on the potential to deploy DIVER within an Intersect
    member institution, contact your university''s <a href="http://intersect.org.au/content/eresearch-analysts"

          listens on Localhost (127.0.0.1). \n Check-Security-02: Is automatic updates\
          \ enabled \n Check whether automatic updates is enabled in operating system.\
          \ \n Check-Security-03: Have you Upgrade operating system kernel \n Check\
          \ whether your operating system kernel is the latest. Kernel upgrade requires\n\
          reboot and you need to schedule this into regular maintenance. \n Check-Security-04:\
          \ Are you running DNS service \n If you are running a DNS server, ensure\
          \ you only allow recursion from trusted\nhosts. \n Check-Security-05: Are\
          \ you running NTP service \n If you run a NTP server, limit which systems\
          \ can access it. Disable the 'monlist'\ncommand as this can be used as a\
          \ denial of service vector on your system. \n Check-Security-06: Have you\
          \ subscribed to security announcements \n If there is a security problem\
          \ with your operating system, you need to find out\nas soon as possible.\
          \ Find the appropriate mailing list and keep an eye\nout for anything that\
          \ requires urgent action. As soon as new security bugs are\ndetected, you\
          \ need to execute security upgrade immediately. \n Check-Security-07: Is\
          \ FireWall running \n Virtual machine should be configured so they allow\
          \ the minimum access required\nto run their service. Please use a host-based\
          \ firewall, in conjunction with\nthe cloud-provided firewall to manage access.\
          \ \n Check-Security-08: Are unneeded accounts in the system \n Keep an eye\
          \ on the user accounts enabled on your system. Some applications\ncreate\
          \ default accounts which are insecure. You may also open a temporary user\n\
          account to allow quick login for a task and leave it forever. This may lead\
          \ to\nsecurity issue later, and you need to regular check and delete these\
          \ user\naccounts. \n Check-Security-09: Is SSH password login disabled \n\
          \ With enough time and compute power it is possible for passwords to be\
          \ brute\nforce attacked. The average SSH server deals with thousands of\
          \ such attacks\nevery week, so use ssh keys. \n Check-Security-10: Are keys\
          \ stored in image \n The cloud provides a metadata service so you can download\
          \ keys on boot, so\nyou don't need to copy keys manually. This ensures that\
          \ if your key is\ncompromised, not all running instances of that image are\
          \ compromised. \n Check-Security-11: Is SSH attack banning tools installed\
          \ \n Install a tools like fail2ban or denyhosts, which checks log files\
          \ for\nattempted breaches and then blocks malicious IP addresses. \n Check-Security-12:\
          \ Are unneeded services disable \n Know what services run on your virtual\
          \ machine, and disable the unneeded ones. \n Check-Security-13: Are Encrypted\
          \ Communications Used \n Wherever possible, use encrypted communications\
          \ to avoid attacks which\nintercept data. \n Check-Security-14: Are logging\
          \ stored in a secure place \n Make sure that services are logging to a secure\
          \ location, that is as\ntamperproof as possible. If logging remotely, ensure\
          \ that it is done over\na secure channel so that eavesdroppers cannot monitor\
          \ what is happening on\nyour instance. \n Check-Security-15: Are ports opened\
          \ for not required services \n By default, virtual machines in NeCTAR has\
          \ closed all ports, so in order to make\nservices available to public, you\
          \ need to open certain ports for it. Before you\nopen a open, you need to\
          \ think carefully about what service associated with it\nand what is the\
          \ intention. Never open ports for non-service binded to it. \n Check-Security-16:\
          \ What permission granted to user account \n When creating user account,\
          \ make sure only permission sufficient for its use \nis granted. Never grant\
          \ extra permission if it is not needed. \n Check-Security-17: Is root access\
          \ disabled from SSH \n Disable root user SSH login and setup user account\
          \ with sudo permission to\nperform administrator tasks. \n Check-Security-18:\
          \ Is other ports used for SSH \n The SSH service on the virtual machine\
          \ uses port 22 by default. This port is \nwell-known and can attract many\
          \ attackers. Use a custom ssh port other than 22\nwill improve security.\

          \ is designed to be similar to eRSA's Tizard supercomputer, but makes use\
          \ of the Australian Research Cloud. \nThe Emu cluster-in-the-cloud is managed\
          \ by eRSA and provides a shared service for eRSA users who don't have a\
          \ resource allocation on the national cloud or don't have the expertise\
          \ to set up and manage a private cluster-in-the-cloud using StarCluster.\
          \ \n Emu currently consists of 136 processing cores, with an eight-core\
          \ machine for the head node and 16 worker nodes to run jobs. Each node has\
          \ eight cores, 32GB RAM and 240GB of local disk. The cluster uses the same\
          \ job management system (Torque) and eRSA user accounts that are used on\
          \ Tizard (and previously on Corvus). The cluster has access to the same\
          \ repository of software packages as \n This service is designed for: \n\
          \ \n South Australian researchers who want to run compute-intensive software\
          \ applications in the cloud without the set-up involved in managing a virtual\
          \ machine. \n Registered eRSA users familiar with Tizard HPC services, who\
          \ would like to use their NeCTAR allocation to have their own node rather\
          \ than share nodes with other users. \n \n \n Differences in the cloud \n\
          \ Due to technical constraints and security policies, we are unable to replicate\
          \ everything in a traditional HPC cluster (such as Tizard) on the cloud.\
          \ However, we aim to provide, as much as possible, a seamless experience\
          \ for users in switching from a traditional HPC cluster to the cluster-in-the-cloud\
          \ approach. \n \n Users employ the same eRSA account to log into Emu and\
          \ the home directory on Emu will be the same as on Tizard. However, the\
          \ '/data' storage is not automatically available. Email the eRSA service\
          \ desk and it may be arranged for the '/data' disk to be made available\
          \ through Emu. Otherwise, data can be transferred using scp or sftp between\
          \ '/data' and the cloud. \n The worker nodes in Emu are dynamic, which means\
          \ they will be launched when there are pending jobs, and shut down when\
          \ nodes are idle. Users may see a different number of worker nodes at different\
          \ times when they check the status of the cluster. \n Currently there is\
          \ no wall-time restriction in Emu. \n In the cloud, there is 4G memory allocated\
          \ per core. So, if someone requests one core and 8GB memory for a job, it\
          \ will be a waste. For such jobs it is recommended to run on the Tizard\
          \ CPU cluster or big memory nodes. On Emu, users don't need to put the memory\
          \ requirement in the job description file as the core/memory ratio is set\
          \ by default. \n The same set of applications are available as for Tizard,\
          \ however licensed software may not be functional in the cloud. Please contact\
          \ our Service Desk if you need to run licensed software. \n \n Glossary\
          \ of Terms  \nTop of page \n \n \n Cloud vs HPC \n There are some differences\
          \ between a cluster in the cloud and an HPC cluster, such as Tizard, which\
          \ has more processors and memory on each node, and a faster communication\
          \ network between the nodes. Some types of computation that run on HPC clusters\
          \ are suitable for running in the cloud, and the cluster-in-the-cloud approach\
          \ should work well for those. \n \n Any eRSA user can use Emu, you don't\
          \ need to have a cloud resource allocation  \n If your research group has\
          \ a cloud allocation, you can use it on Emu, so it's like having a private\
          \ sub-cluster \n Run compute jobs in the same way as for eRSA HPC clusters\
          \ (e.g Tizard) \n There is no wall-time restriction on Emu (usually limited\
          \ to 100 hours with Tizard) \n \n However, some types of applications are\
          \ not well-suited to the cloud and would run better on HPC cluster. Examples\
          \ of such applications include: \n \n Parallel programs that can run only\
          \ on a single compute node and need more than eight processing cores or\
          \ 32GB memory \n Parallel (multi-processor) programs that need to run on\
          \ more than eight cores and can use multiple compute nodes (e.g. MPI programs)\
          \ but require a lot of interprocessor communication, particularly low-latency\
          \ communication \n Programs that need more than 4GB of memory per processing\
          \ core \n Programs that have more than about 500GB total of input and output\
          \ files \n Applications that run on GPUs \n \n If you are unsure of whether\
          \ or not your application is suitable for the cloud, contact our Service\
          \ Desk. \n \n \n Register for an eRSA account \n To access the Emu cluster\
          \ in the cloud, you will need to be [registered with eResearchSA]. You will\
          \ be provided with an eRSA username and password which you will use to access\
          \ the Emu cluster. Email the eRSA Helpdesk with any queries. \n \n Emu submit\
          \ node \n \n Emu's submit node is 'emu.ersa.edu.au' \n To run jobs in the\
          \ Emu cluster, you must login to the Emu submit node via SSH with your eRSA\
          \ username and password. \n You can run short (a few minutes) test jobs\
          \ on the commandline of the submit node without using the queueing system.\
          \ \n Longer jobs are submitted to the Torque queueing system with a submission\
          \ script. \n \n Glossary of Terms  \nTop of page \n \n \n Connecting to\
          \ Emu \n \n Emu is accessible via SSH. \n \n \n Windows users \n \n Windows\
          \ users can make use of free ssh clients such as putty.  \n \nPutty Download\
          \   \n \n Instructions for downloading Putty \n \n \n In the Putty configuration\
          \ window, enter emu.ersa.edu.au as the \"Host Name (or IP Address)\", then\
          \ click 'Open'. \n \n You will be prompted for your username and password.\
          \ \n \n \n Mac and Linux users \n \n Open the Terminal application (for\
          \ Mac, look under Applications -> Utilities. \n Then run: \nssh username@emu.ersa.edu.au\n\

          Top of page \n \n \n Storage \n \n As with other clusters managed by eRSA,\
          \ there are three storage areas that jobs have access to: \n \n/home/users,\
          \ which contains user home directories, and is accessible on all worker\
          \ nodes via NFS but has limited space (50GB).  \n \n/scratch, which provides\
          \ a larger temporary storage area, and is accessible from all nodes of the\
          \ cluster, but uses NFS and will therefore be slower than /tmp. This is\
          \ the disk location from which the user must run jobs. \n \n/tmp, which\
          \ is fast, temporary storage that is local to a particular worker node in\
          \ the cluster. It should be used only for the duration of a single job and\
          \ cleaned up after the job has finished. On Emu it is 240GB per worker node,\
          \ which is smaller than the local /tmp storageTizard nodes. \n \n Glossary\
          \ of Terms  \nTop of page \n \n \n General information on using eRSA supercomputers\
          \ \n \n Please read the general information about Using Supercomputers,\
          \ which is relevant to all eRSA supercomputers. \n \n An overview of the\
          \ steps for running a job on Emu (details in the following sections): \n\
          \ \n Create a folder in the '/scratch' directory to use as a working directory\
          \ for running jobs \n Copy the Emu submission script and your input files\
          \ to this directory \n Check which modules you need to load to run the job\
          \ \n Edit the emu submission script - with a comand-line editor or with\
          \ FileZilla\n \n Submit the script, and await an email informing you the\
          \ job is complete \n \n \n Exploring the available software packages \n\
          \ The 'module' commands allow users to: \n \n List the available packages\
          \ (modules) on Emu \nmodule avail \nmodule avail <search term>  - search\
          \ for a particular package   \n Find out what dependencies are required\
          \ to be loaded before the package of interest can be loaded \nmodule whatis\
          \ <package name>  -  make note of any required modules\n \n Load the packages,\
          \ by entering the module load ... command in the PBS submission script.\
          \ \n \n NOTE: If there is software that you would like to access that is\
          \ not already in the software repository, email the eRSA Helpdesk and request\
          \ that it be added. Ensure you mention that you would like to access it\
          \ through Emu cluster in the cloud. \n \n Submit your job using Torque/PBS\
          \ queuing system \n \n As with all eRSA supercomputers, you submit jobs\
          \ to Emu using the Torque job management (or queueing) system. \n Introduction\
          \ and Tutorial on using the Torque/PBS Queuing System \n Running jobs with\
          \ a Torque submission script \n \n There is a template of the Emu submission\
          \ script in the home folder. After you have logged on to emu.ersa.edu.au,\
          \ the script is in the '~/.templates' directory. \n \n look at the file:\
          \ \nless ~/.templates/emu.sub\n \n create a directory to work from in '/scratch',\
          \  \n  e.g. mkdir -p /scratch/MyDirectory/MyExperiment1\n \n copy the emu\
          \ submission script to your directory \n  e.g. cp ~/.templates/emu.sub /scratch/MyDirectory/MyExperiment1/experiment1.sub\n\
          \ \n Navigate to the directory  \n  e.g. cd /scratch/MyDirectory/MyExperiment1\n\
          \ \n Edit the submission script with nano experiment1.sub (or use the file\
          \ edit option in FileZilla)   \n \nReplace the following terms in bold in\
          \ the submission script\n \n MyJobName  \n Your-email-Address  \n \n#PBS\
          \ -l ncpus=X - enter the number of processors required (up to 8, unless\
          \ you have a private allocation with 16 CPUs) \n \n#PBS -l walltime=HH:MM:SS\
          \ - Enter the maximum time the process will take, or put \"###\" at the\
          \ start of this line so it is ignored. \n \nmodule load application_module\
          \ - load any required modules first (see the output from the  module whatis\
          \ command above). Then on a new line, load the program you will use. \n\
          \ \n MyProgram+Arguments - Enter the command to start the program, as you\
          \ would enter it on the command line on your own computer. \n \n \n Copy\
          \ your input files to the directory. \n \n To submit the job, enter: \n\
          \  e.g. qsub experiment1.sub \nqstat - check that the job is running. You\
          \ will receive an email when the job ends. \n \n Glossary of Terms  \nTop\
          \ of page \n \n \n Sharing files with the virtual machine \n There is a\
          \ NeCTAR training module and support guide with comprehensive details on\
          \ transferring data between a cloud VM and your local computer or remote\
          \ storage servers.  \n Using programs like FileZilla or WinSCP is an easy\
          \ method of transferring data from your local computer.  \n See the Appendix\
          \ for a quick guide to copying data between Emu and your eRSA /data storage.\
          \ There is an eRSA support page with more detail on transferring data from\
          \ eRSA storage. \n Glossary of Terms  \nTop of page \n \n \n Using your\
          \ own cloud allocation \n Emu allows you the option to use your own NeCTAR\
          \ cloud resource allocation to start-up worker nodes. These worker nodes\
          \ will be exclusive to your group only and are not shared with other groups.\
          \ A useful feature is that if all your worker nodes are busy, your job will\
          \ be able to be scheduled to the shared worker nodes (contributed by eRSA)\
          \ if any of them is free. If this is still not enough, you can request more\
          \ cores from NeCTAR and we can bump up your own share in Emu so it can start\
          \ up more exclusive worker nodes for you. \n To set this up, you need to\
          \ follow these steps: \n \n Follow this guide to get a NeCTAR account\n\
          \ \n Apply for a NeCTAR cloud resource allocation by logging in to the NeCTAR\
          \ web dashboard and going to the New Request page under Allocations in the\
          \ menu. Contact our Service Desk if you need help in filling in the allocation\
          \ request. \n If you request persistent cloud storage (volume storage),\
          \ this can be set up to be used by your worker nodes. Note that this needs\
          \ one extra core to run a file server. For example, if you need eight cores\
          \ for your job, and you also request some volume storage, you will need\
          \ to request a total of nine cores. \n Send an email to our Service Desk\
          \ with the following information: \n Your NeCTAR project name \n A short,\
          \ one-word name to identify your project in your Torque/PBS job submission\
          \ script \n How many worker nodes you want to be used by Emu and how many\
          \ cores each one should have (note that the total number of cores must be\
          \ less than or equal to your NeCTAR project allocation) \n Do you have volume\
          \ storage to use? If so, how much do you want to be accessible from Emu?\
          \ \n A list of users who are allowed to use these worker nodes (please provide\
          \ their eRSA usernames). \n In order for eRSA to set up Emu in your project\
          \ allocation, the project manager (the user who requested the allocation)\
          \ must add the eRSA cloud support staff member as a user. This is done by\
          \ selecting the \"Users\" option in the project menu on the NeCTAR dashboard\
          \ and entering the email address of the eRSA team member that is assisting\
          \ you. \n \n Once we receive your email request, we will set up Emu to use\
          \ your allocation. On completion of setup, you can add a flag -A when running\
          \ your job script to specify the project name in order to make use of your\
          \ dedicated worker nodes. In your Torque/PBS job script, add the following\
          \ line (using your actual project name rather than myprojectname): \n  \
          \   #PBS -A myprojectname\n \n Alternatively, you can specify the project\
          \ name as a command line option to the qsub job submission command, as follows:\
          \ \n     $ qsub -A myprojectname myjobscript.sub\n \n If you don't know\
          \ or can't remember the project name, you can just type anything after the\
          \ -A flag and you will get an error message telling you what project names\
          \ you are eligible to use. \n If you do not specify a project name, the\
          \ job will be run on the shared worker nodes of the cluster. \n If you want\
          \ to run jobs ONLY on your own worker nodes, add myprojectname to the nodes'\
          \ properties. For example, in the job scripts, it can be \n     #PBS -l\
          \ nodes=1:myprojectname\n \n Glossary of Terms  \nTop of page \n \n \n The\
          \ name \n \n Clusters managed by eRSA have traditionally been given names\
          \ of constellations. In this case, we also wanted to somehow incorporate\
          \ the concept of \"cloud\". We chose the name based on a constellation from\
          \ Aboriginal culture, the Emu in the sky, which is not based on stars, but\
          \ rather on dust clouds in our galaxy creating dark areas in the Milky Way\
          \ between the Southern Cross and Scorpius, which resemble the outline of\
          \ an emu. \n \n Top of page \n \n \n Appendices \n \n An example Torque\
          \ submission script \n This is an example of modifying a copy of the 'emu.sub'\
          \ submission script template to run an executable 'process_radtags' from\
          \ a package called 'Stacks'. The first step is to check the availability\
          \ of the package, and what modules need to be loaded first as a prerequisite\
          \ for loading Stacks. Then the script is modified as highlighted for submission\
          \ of the job. \n \n \n Top of page \n \n \n Modify a Tizard submision script\
          \ for Emu \n If you have an existing submission script based on the 'tizard.sub',\
          \ you can convert it to an Emu submission script with the simple changes\
          \ highlighted below. \n \n Top of page \n \n \n A quick guide to copying\
          \ files from eRSA '/data' storage \n The following information outlines\
          \ commands that can be entered on your VM in order to transfer data to and\
          \ from remote data storage, such as the eRSA '/data' storage block. There\
          \ is an eRSA support page with more detail on transferring data from eRSA\
          \ storage. \n Secure Copy (SCP) between the VM and a data storage server\
          \ \n If you have data stored on a remote server, you can transfer files\
          \ by using the 'scp' command while logged on to 'emu.ersa.edu.au'. \n scp\
          \ <source> <destination> \n \n To download to the VM : scp <remote computer>:<path\
          \ to file> <Emu directory>   \n e.g. to get files from '/data' and copy\
          \ to the working directory: \n \n scp username@sftp.ersa.edu.au:/data/<path\
          \ to file> ./  \n \n \n To upload to data storage : scp <Emu file> <remote\
          \ computer>:<path to directory> \n \n e.g. to save results to '/data' \n\
          \ \n scp results.zip username@sftp.ersa.edu.au:/data/myDirectory/ \n \n\
          \ \n You will be prompted to enter the password for your data storage. \n\
          \ \n \n SFTP via the Command Line \n Secure file transfer is also available\
          \ between the VM and remote data storage. This is useful when you aren't\
          \ sure of the file structure on the remote server, because it allows you\
          \ to navigate to a file before you download it. \n Enter the 'sftp' command\
          \ while logged on to 'emu.ersa.edu.au', and you will have access to the\
          \ remote storage server. \n sftp username@sftp.ersa.edu.au   - you will\
          \ be prompted for a password. \n You are now accessing the remote data storage\
          \ server, and you can navigate the files on the server as per usual with\
          \ commands like cd and ls. \nThe commands get and put will transfer data\
          \ between the machines: \n \n get <remote_server_file.txt> <localEMU_destination/>\
          \ \n \ncd /data/<My directory> , ls - navigate to your files on the remote\
          \ server \n \n get file.data ./ - fetch the file from the server to the\
          \ Emu working directory \n \n \n put <localEMU_destination/file.txt> <remote_directory/>\
          \ \n \n put results.zip /data/<My directory> \n \n to close the sftp connection,\
          \ type exit. \n \n \n Glossary \n Dashboard \n \n The NeCTAR Dashboard is\

          <p>Emu is a cluster that is designed to be similar to eRSA's Tizard supercomputer,\
          \ but makes use of the <a href=\"http://www.nectar.org.au/research-cloud/\"\
          >Australian Research Cloud</a>. \nThe Emu cluster-in-the-cloud is managed\
          \ by eRSA and provides a shared service for eRSA users who don't have a\
          \ resource allocation on the national cloud or don't have the expertise\
          \ to set up and manage a private cluster-in-the-cloud using <a href=\"star-cluster.html\"\
          >StarCluster</a>.</p>\n<p>Emu currently consists of 136 processing cores,\
          \ with an eight-core machine for the head node and 16 worker nodes to run\
          \ jobs. Each node has eight cores, 32GB RAM and 240GB of local disk. The\
          \ cluster uses the same job management system (Torque) and eRSA user accounts\
          \ that are used on Tizard (and previously on Corvus). The cluster has access\
          \ to the same repository of software packages as</p>\n<p>This service is\
          \ designed for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>South Australian researchers who want to\
          \ run compute-intensive software applications in the cloud without the set-up\
          \ involved in managing a virtual machine.</li>\n<li>Registered eRSA users\
          \ familiar with Tizard HPC services, who would like to use their NeCTAR\
          \ allocation to have their own node rather than share nodes with other users.</li>\n\
          </ul>\n<p><a name=\"differences-in-the-cloud\"></a></p>\n<h2>Differences\
          \ in the cloud</h2>\n<p>Due to technical constraints and security policies,\
          \ we are unable to replicate everything in a traditional HPC cluster (such\
          \ as Tizard) on the cloud. However, we aim to provide, as much as possible,\
          \ a seamless experience for users in switching from a traditional HPC cluster\
          \ to the cluster-in-the-cloud approach.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Users employ the\
          \ same eRSA account to log into Emu and the home directory on Emu will be\
          \ the same as on Tizard. However, the '/data' storage is not automatically\
          \ available. Email the <a href=\"mailto:servicedesk@ersa.edu.au\">eRSA service\
          \ desk</a> and it may be arranged for the '/data' disk to be made available\
          \ through Emu. Otherwise, data can be <a href=\"#app1\">transferred using\
          \ <strong>scp</strong> or <strong>sftp</strong></a> between '/data' and\
          \ the cloud.</li>\n<li>The worker nodes in Emu are dynamic, which means\
          \ they will be launched when there are pending jobs, and shut down when\
          \ nodes are idle. Users may see a different number of worker nodes at different\
          \ times when they check the status of the cluster.</li>\n<li>Currently there\
          \ is no wall-time restriction in Emu.</li>\n<li>In the cloud, there is 4G\
          \ memory allocated per core. So, if someone requests one core and 8GB memory\
          \ for a job, it will be a waste. For such jobs it is recommended to run\
          \ on the Tizard CPU cluster or big memory nodes. On Emu, users don't need\
          \ to put the memory requirement in the job description file as the core/memory\
          \ ratio is set by default.</li>\n<li>The same set of applications are available\
          \ as for Tizard, however licensed software may not be functional in the\
          \ cloud. Please contact our <a href=\"mailto:servicedesk@ersa.edu.au\">Service\

          <h2>Cloud vs HPC</h2>\n<p>There are some differences between a cluster in\
          \ the cloud and an HPC cluster, such as Tizard, which has more processors\
          \ and memory on each node, and a faster communication network between the\
          \ nodes. Some types of computation that run on HPC clusters are suitable\
          \ for running in the cloud, and the cluster-in-the-cloud approach should\
          \ work well for those.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Any eRSA user can use Emu, you don't\
          \ need to have a cloud resource allocation </li>\n<li>If your research group\
          \ has a cloud allocation, you can use it on Emu, so it's like having a private\
          \ sub-cluster</li>\n<li>Run compute jobs in the same way as for eRSA HPC\
          \ clusters (e.g Tizard)</li>\n<li>There is no wall-time restriction on Emu\
          \ (usually limited to 100 hours with Tizard)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, some\
          \ types of applications are not well-suited to the cloud and would run better\
          \ on HPC cluster. Examples of such applications include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Parallel\
          \ programs that can run only on a single compute node and need more than\
          \ eight processing cores or 32GB memory</li>\n<li>Parallel (multi-processor)\
          \ programs that need to run on more than eight cores and can use multiple\
          \ compute nodes (e.g. MPI programs) but require a lot of interprocessor\
          \ communication, particularly low-latency communication</li>\n<li>Programs\
          \ that need more than 4GB of memory per processing core</li>\n<li>Programs\
          \ that have more than about 500GB total of input and output files</li>\n\
          <li>Applications that run on GPUs</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you are unsure of whether\
          \ or not your application is suitable for the cloud, contact our <a href=\"\

          \ we will set up Emu to use your allocation. On completion of setup, you\
          \ can add a flag <code>-A</code> when running your job script to specify\
          \ the project name in order to make use of your dedicated worker nodes.\
          \ In your Torque/PBS job script, add the following line (using your actual\

          <p>The following information outlines commands that can be entered on your\
          \ VM in order to transfer data to and from remote data storage, such as\
          \ the eRSA '/data' storage block. There is an <a href=\"http://support.ersa.edu.au/storage/quick-start.html\"\
          >eRSA support page</a> with more detail on transferring data from eRSA storage.</p>\n\
          <h4>Secure Copy (SCP) between the VM and a data storage server</h4>\n<p>If\
          \ you have data stored on a remote server, you can transfer files by using\
          \ the 'scp' command while logged on to 'emu.ersa.edu.au'.</p>\n<p><code>scp\
          \ &lt;source&gt; &lt;destination&gt;</code></p>\n<ul>\n<li>To download to\
          \ the VM : <code>scp &lt;remote computer&gt;:&lt;path to file&gt; &lt;Emu\
          \ directory&gt;</code>  </li>\n<li>e.g. to get files from '/data' and copy\
          \ to the working directory:</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>scp username@sftp.ersa.edu.au:/data/&lt;path\
          \ to file&gt; ./</code> </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To upload to data storage\
          \ : <code>scp &lt;Emu file&gt; &lt;remote computer&gt;:&lt;path to directory&gt;</code></p>\n\
          </li>\n<li>e.g. to save results to '/data'</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>scp results.zip\

          \ is also available between the VM and remote data storage. This is useful\
          \ when you aren't sure of the file structure on the remote server, because\
          \ it allows you to navigate to a file before you download it.</p>\n<p>Enter\
          \ the 'sftp' command while logged on to 'emu.ersa.edu.au', and you will\
          \ have access to the remote storage server.</p>\n<p><code>sftp username@sftp.ersa.edu.au</code>\
          \   - you will be prompted for a password.</p>\n<p>You are now accessing\
          \ the remote data storage server, and you can navigate the files on the\
          \ server as per usual with commands like <code>cd</code> and <code>ls</code>.<br>\n\
          The commands <code>get</code> and <code>put</code> will transfer data between\

    <p>Emu is a cluster that is designed to be similar to eRSA's Tizard supercomputer,\
    \ but makes use of the <a href=\"http://www.nectar.org.au/research-cloud/\">Australian\
    \ Research Cloud</a>. \nThe Emu cluster-in-the-cloud is managed by eRSA and provides\
    \ a shared service for eRSA users who don't have a resource allocation on the\
    \ national cloud or don't have the expertise to set up and manage a private cluster-in-the-cloud\
    \ using <a href=\"star-cluster.html\">StarCluster</a>.</p>\n<p>Emu currently consists\
    \ of 136 processing cores, with an eight-core machine for the head node and 16\
    \ worker nodes to run jobs. Each node has eight cores, 32GB RAM and 240GB of local\
    \ disk. The cluster uses the same job management system (Torque) and eRSA user\
    \ accounts that are used on Tizard (and previously on Corvus). The cluster has\
    \ access to the same repository of software packages as</p>\n<p>This service is\
    \ designed for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>South Australian researchers who want to run compute-intensive\
    \ software applications in the cloud without the set-up involved in managing a\
    \ virtual machine.</li>\n<li>Registered eRSA users familiar with Tizard HPC services,\
    \ who would like to use their NeCTAR allocation to have their own node rather\
    \ than share nodes with other users.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a name=\"differences-in-the-cloud\"\
    ></a></p>\n<h2>Differences in the cloud</h2>\n<p>Due to technical constraints\
    \ and security policies, we are unable to replicate everything in a traditional\
    \ HPC cluster (such as Tizard) on the cloud. However, we aim to provide, as much\
    \ as possible, a seamless experience for users in switching from a traditional\
    \ HPC cluster to the cluster-in-the-cloud approach.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Users employ\
    \ the same eRSA account to log into Emu and the home directory on Emu will be\
    \ the same as on Tizard. However, the '/data' storage is not automatically available.\
    \ Email the <a href=\"mailto:servicedesk@ersa.edu.au\">eRSA service desk</a> and\
    \ it may be arranged for the '/data' disk to be made available through Emu. Otherwise,\
    \ data can be <a href=\"#app1\">transferred using <strong>scp</strong> or <strong>sftp</strong></a>\
    \ between '/data' and the cloud.</li>\n<li>The worker nodes in Emu are dynamic,\
    \ which means they will be launched when there are pending jobs, and shut down\
    \ when nodes are idle. Users may see a different number of worker nodes at different\
    \ times when they check the status of the cluster.</li>\n<li>Currently there is\
    \ no wall-time restriction in Emu.</li>\n<li>In the cloud, there is 4G memory\
    \ allocated per core. So, if someone requests one core and 8GB memory for a job,\
    \ it will be a waste. For such jobs it is recommended to run on the Tizard CPU\
    \ cluster or big memory nodes. On Emu, users don't need to put the memory requirement\
    \ in the job description file as the core/memory ratio is set by default.</li>\n\
    <li>The same set of applications are available as for Tizard, however licensed\
    \ software may not be functional in the cloud. Please contact our <a href=\"mailto:servicedesk@ersa.edu.au\"\
    >Service Desk</a> if you need to run licensed software.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"\

    \ vs HPC</h2>\n<p>There are some differences between a cluster in the cloud and\
    \ an HPC cluster, such as Tizard, which has more processors and memory on each\
    \ node, and a faster communication network between the nodes. Some types of computation\
    \ that run on HPC clusters are suitable for running in the cloud, and the cluster-in-the-cloud\
    \ approach should work well for those.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Any eRSA user can use Emu,\
    \ you don't need to have a cloud resource allocation </li>\n<li>If your research\
    \ group has a cloud allocation, you can use it on Emu, so it's like having a private\
    \ sub-cluster</li>\n<li>Run compute jobs in the same way as for eRSA HPC clusters\
    \ (e.g Tizard)</li>\n<li>There is no wall-time restriction on Emu (usually limited\
    \ to 100 hours with Tizard)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, some types of applications\
    \ are not well-suited to the cloud and would run better on HPC cluster. Examples\
    \ of such applications include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Parallel programs that can run\
    \ only on a single compute node and need more than eight processing cores or 32GB\
    \ memory</li>\n<li>Parallel (multi-processor) programs that need to run on more\
    \ than eight cores and can use multiple compute nodes (e.g. MPI programs) but\
    \ require a lot of interprocessor communication, particularly low-latency communication</li>\n\
    <li>Programs that need more than 4GB of memory per processing core</li>\n<li>Programs\
    \ that have more than about 500GB total of input and output files</li>\n<li>Applications\

    <li><strong>/home/users</strong>, which contains user home directories, and is\
    \ accessible on all worker nodes via NFS but has limited space (50GB). </li>\n\
    <li><strong>/scratch</strong>, which provides a larger temporary storage area,\
    \ and is accessible from all nodes of the cluster, but uses NFS and will therefore\
    \ be slower than /tmp. This is the disk location from which the user must run\
    \ jobs.</li>\n<li><strong>/tmp</strong>, which is fast, temporary storage that\
    \ is local to a particular worker node in the cluster. It should be used only\
    \ for the duration of a single job and cleaned up after the job has finished.\
    \ On Emu it is 240GB per worker node, which is smaller than the local /tmp storageTizard\

    <p>Emu allows you the option to use your own NeCTAR cloud resource allocation\
    \ to start-up worker nodes. These worker nodes will be exclusive to your group\
    \ only and are not shared with other groups. A useful feature is that if all your\
    \ worker nodes are busy, your job will be able to be scheduled to the shared worker\
    \ nodes (contributed by eRSA) if any of them is free. If this is still not enough,\
    \ you can request more cores from NeCTAR and we can bump up your own share in\
    \ Emu so it can start up more exclusive worker nodes for you.</p>\n<p>To set this\
    \ up, you need to follow these steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Follow this <a href=\"https://support.nectar.org.au/support/solutions/articles/6000055377-getting-an-account\"\
    >guide to get a NeCTAR account</a></li>\n<li>Apply for a <a href=\"https://support.nectar.org.au/support/solutions/articles/6000068044-managing-an-allocation\"\

    \ in the menu. Contact our <a href=\"mailto:servicedesk@ersa.edu.au\">Service\
    \ Desk</a> if you need help in filling in the allocation request.</li>\n<li>If\
    \ you request persistent cloud storage (<a href=\"https://support.nectar.org.au/support/solutions/articles/6000055382-introduction-to-cloud-storage\"\
    >volume storage</a>), this can be set up to be used by your worker nodes. Note\
    \ that this needs one extra core to run a file server. For example, if you need\
    \ eight cores for your job, and you also request some volume storage, you will\
    \ need to request a total of nine cores.</li>\n<li>Send an email to our <a href=\"\
    mailto:servicedesk@ersa.edu.au\">Service Desk</a> with the following information:</li>\n\
    <li>Your NeCTAR project name</li>\n<li>A short, one-word name to identify your\
    \ project in your Torque/PBS job submission script</li>\n<li>How many worker nodes\
    \ you want to be used by Emu and how many cores each one should have (note that\
    \ the total number of cores must be less than or equal to your NeCTAR project\
    \ allocation)</li>\n<li>Do you have volume storage to use? If so, how much do\
    \ you want to be accessible from Emu?</li>\n<li>A list of users who are allowed\
    \ to use these worker nodes (please provide their eRSA usernames).</li>\n<li>In\
    \ order for eRSA to set up Emu in your project allocation, the project manager\
    \ (the user who requested the allocation) must add the eRSA cloud support staff\
    \ member as a user. This is done by selecting the \"Users\" option in the project\
    \ menu on the NeCTAR <a href=\"https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au/project/members/\"\
    >dashboard</a> and entering the email address of the eRSA team member that is\
    \ assisting you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once we receive your email request, we will set\
    \ up Emu to use your allocation. On completion of setup, you can add a flag <code>-A</code>\
    \ when running your job script to specify the project name in order to make use\
    \ of your dedicated worker nodes. In your Torque/PBS job script, add the following\
    \ line (using your actual project name rather than <code>myprojectname</code>):</p>\n\
    <pre><code>    #PBS -A myprojectname\n</code></pre>\n<p>Alternatively, you can\
    \ specify the project name as a command line option to the qsub job submission\
    \ command, as follows:</p>\n<pre><code>    $ qsub -A myprojectname myjobscript.sub\n\
    </code></pre>\n<p>If you don't know or can't remember the project name, you can\
    \ just type anything after the <code>-A</code> flag and you will get an error\
    \ message telling you what project names you are eligible to use.</p>\n<p>If you\
    \ do not specify a project name, the job will be run on the shared worker nodes\
    \ of the cluster.</p>\n<p>If you want to run jobs ONLY on your own worker nodes,\
    \ add <code>myprojectname</code> to the nodes' properties. For example, in the\
    \ job scripts, it can be</p>\n<pre><code>    #PBS -l nodes=1:myprojectname\n</code></pre>\n\

    \ There is an <a href=\"http://support.ersa.edu.au/storage/quick-start.html\"\
    >eRSA support page</a> with more detail on transferring data from eRSA storage.</p>\n\
    <h4>Secure Copy (SCP) between the VM and a data storage server</h4>\n<p>If you\
    \ have data stored on a remote server, you can transfer files by using the 'scp'\
    \ command while logged on to 'emu.ersa.edu.au'.</p>\n<p><code>scp &lt;source&gt;\
    \ &lt;destination&gt;</code></p>\n<ul>\n<li>To download to the VM : <code>scp\
    \ &lt;remote computer&gt;:&lt;path to file&gt; &lt;Emu directory&gt;</code>  </li>\n\
    <li>e.g. to get files from '/data' and copy to the working directory:</li>\n<li>\n\
    <p><code>scp username@sftp.ersa.edu.au:/data/&lt;path to file&gt; ./</code> </p>\n\
    </li>\n<li>\n<p>To upload to data storage : <code>scp &lt;Emu file&gt; &lt;remote\
    \ computer&gt;:&lt;path to directory&gt;</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>e.g. to save results\
    \ to '/data'</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>scp results.zip username@sftp.ersa.edu.au:/data/myDirectory/</code></p>\n\
    </li>\n<li>\n<p>You will be prompted to enter the password for your data storage.</p>\n\
    </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>SFTP via the Command Line</h4>\n<p>Secure file transfer is also\
    \ available between the VM and remote data storage. This is useful when you aren't\
    \ sure of the file structure on the remote server, because it allows you to navigate\
    \ to a file before you download it.</p>\n<p>Enter the 'sftp' command while logged\
    \ on to 'emu.ersa.edu.au', and you will have access to the remote storage server.</p>\n\
    <p><code>sftp username@sftp.ersa.edu.au</code>   - you will be prompted for a\
    \ password.</p>\n<p>You are now accessing the remote data storage server, and\
    \ you can navigate the files on the server as per usual with commands like <code>cd</code>\
    \ and <code>ls</code>.<br>\nThe commands <code>get</code> and <code>put</code>\
    \ will transfer data between the machines:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>get &lt;remote_server_file.txt&gt;\
    \ &lt;localEMU_destination/&gt;</code></li>\n<li><code>cd /data/&lt;My directory&gt;</code>\
    \ , <code>ls</code> - navigate to your files on the remote server</li>\n<li>\n\

          \ \n This document is intended to be a starting point for a NeCTAR VM user\
          \ who\nwishes to gain access to files stored in an NFS file server.  It\
          \ does not\ndeal with how to set up and secure an NFS file server, or how\
          \ to set up\nidentity management to support per-user access control. \n\
          \ Note that these instructions are intended to be generic.  If you need\
          \ to\nacccess NFS servers implemented by a specific NeCTAR Node operator\
          \ (for\nexample the QRIScloud RDSI collection servers), or virtual laboratory,\n\
          contact them for any service specific instructions. \n Background \n NFS\
          \ (Network File System) is a protocol that allows one Linux or Unix system\n\
          to \"mount\" a file system that consists of collection of files and directories\n\
          that are stored on a different system. \n The NFS protocol is designed to\
          \ allow fast access to files over a local area\nnetwork.  It supports the\
          \ full range of Linux / Unix file system functionality,\nand allows different\
          \ systems to simultaneously access and update shared files\nand directories.\
          \ \n An NFS file system is \"exported\" by a server to one or more client\
          \ machines.\nThe clients gain access by \"mounting\" the NFS file system\
          \ within the namespace\nof the client's local file system. \n Prerequisites\
          \ \n The following skills and privileges are required for the client-side\
          \ setup. \n \n \n Basic Linux system admin skills. \n \n \n Root privilege\
          \ / sudo access on the client NeCTAR VM. \n \n \n In addition: \n \n \n\
          \ You need to know the IP address of the NFS server, and the \"mount\n \
          \   path\" that identifies the directory tree that you have been granted\n\
          \    access to.  (The NFS server administrators will typically need to\n\
          \    enable access to your instance's IP address in the server's \"exports\"\
          \n    file.) \n \n \n The NFS server needs to be addressible by your client\
          \ VM at the\n    IP protocol level.  If the NFS server has a private IP\
          \ address, then\n    your client typically needs a viable route to that\
          \ network.  (For\n    QRIScloud, this is achieved using the instance's second\
          \ virtual NIC.) \n \n \n Any firewalls need to have been configured to allow\
          \ NFS traffic on\n    port 111 (TCP and UDP) and 2049 (TCP and UDP).  Cluster\
          \ status\n    requires port 1110 (TCP), and client status requires port\
          \ 1110 (UDP), and\n    the NFS lock manager requires port 4045 (TCP and\
          \ UDP). \n \n \n Installing NFS client software \n Before you attempt to\
          \ use client-side NFS, you need to install some packages\nusing your system's\
          \ package manager. \n On a Debian, Ubuntu or similar system by running the\
          \ following commands: \n $ sudo apt-get update\n   $ sudo apt-get install\
          \ nfs-common autofs \n On RedHat, CentOS or Scientific Linux, run the following:\
          \ \n $ sudo yum install nfs-utils autofs \n On (recent) Fedora, run the\
          \ following: \n $ sudo dnf install nfs-utils autofs \n (The \"autofs\" package\
          \ is needed if you want to configure the NFS client\nto automount the remote\
          \ file systems.) \n Configuring the NFS mount \n There are (at least) 3\
          \ ways to mount a file system on a remote NFS server \n \n With a temporary\
          \ mount, the mount does not survive an instance reboot. \n With a permanent\
          \ mount, the file system is mounted automatically on\n    instance startup.\
          \ \n With an automount, the file system is mounted when some program tries\n\
          \    to access files, and then unmounted after a period of inactivity. \n\
          \ \n The NFS mount string and options \n The NFS mount string and mount\
          \ options are the key pieces of information\nthat are needed when an NFS\
          \ file system is mounted. \n The  specifies the remote NFS file system to\
          \ be mounted\non your client VM.  It consists of the NFS server's IP address,\
          \ and\nan exported NFS path, with a colon between them.  For example: \n\
          \ 10.255.120.220:/users/fred\n \n The  determine how the client-side kernel\
          \ manages\nNFS access.  We recommend the following NFS mount options as\
          \ a\nstarting point: \n rw,hard,intr,nosuid,nodev,timeo=100,retrans=5,nolock\n\
          \ \n or the following if you need to use NFS version 3: \n rw,nfsvers=3,hard,intr,nosuid,nodev,timeo=100,retrans=5,nolock\n\
          \ \n The above parameters have the following meanings: \n \n \n \"rw\" means\
          \ mount the file system with read-write access.  An alternative\n    is\
          \ \"ro\" for read-only access. \n \n \n \"hard\" instructs the system to\
          \ attempt to retry \"for ever\" to reconnect\n    if the client looses its\
          \ NFS connection.  This is strongly recommended. \n \n \n \"intr\" is a\
          \ backwards compatibility flag. \n \n \n \"nosuid\" tells the kernel to\
          \ ignore the \"set user id\" flag on executables. \n \n \n \"nodev\" treats\
          \ \"device files\" as uninterpretted. \n \n \n the \"timeo\" value is the\
          \ timeout (in 10ths of a second) for NFS\n    request retransmission if\
          \ the client gets no response. \n \n \n the \"retrans\" value is the number\
          \ of simple retries before the client\n    attempts further recovery actions.\
          \ \n \n \n \"nolock\" disables file locking on the server.  (If a client-side\
          \ program\n    locks a file, the lock's coverage is limited to just this\
          \ client.) \n \n \n For more details on these and other NFS mount parameters,\
          \ please refer to\n\"man 5 nfs\" and other NFS documentation. \n The mount\
          \ point \n When a Linux (or UNIX) system mounts a file system, it mounts\
          \ it on top\nof an existing directory.  That directory is known as the mount\
          \ point.\nIf you are doing a temporary NFS mount, or setting up a permanent\
          \ mount,\nthe mount point directory needs to be created manually.  (If you\
          \ are\nusing the automount approach, the mount point directory can be created\n\
          automatically.)  \n The normal Linux convention is to either use \"/mnt\"\
          \ or a subdirectory\nof \"/mnt\" as the mount point.  However NeCTAR VMs\
          \ use \"/mnt\" as the mount\npoint for the (so-called) ephemeral file system.\
          \ \n You can use the \"mkdir\" command to create the mountpoint directory.\
          \  It is\nprobably advisable to create it in direcftory that cannot be written\
          \ by\nunprivileged users. \n Creating a temporary NFS mount \n Before you\
          \ get into the (relative) complexity of setting up a permanent\nmount or\
          \ an automount, it is a good idea to check that you can access\nthe NFS\
          \ server by setting up a temporary mount.  You can also use this\napproach\
          \ for once-off or ad-hoc access to NFS. \n The steps are as follows: \n\
          \ \n \n Create a temporary mount point: \n  mkdir ~/tempMount\n \n \n \n\
          \ Run the mount command: \n  sudo mount -t nfs -o <mount-options> <mount-string>\
          \ ~/tempMount\n \n where the  and  are as described above. \n \n \n Check\
          \ that you can access data on the mounted file system: \n  $ ls -l ~/tempMount\n\
          \ <directory listing>\n \n \n \n When you are done, unmount the file system\
          \ and tidy up the mount point: \n  sudo umount ~/tempMount\n \n rmdir ~/tempMount\
          \ \n Note that the \"umount\" will fail if any process (including as shell)\n\
          \ has files on the mounted file system open, or if it has a directory\n\
          \ in the file system as its current directory. \n \n \n Configuring a fixed\
          \ NFS mount \n Fixed mounts are typically configured by adding entries to\
          \ the \"/etc/fstab\"\nfile.  This file is consulted to work out which file\
          \ systems to mount on\nsystem startup.  It is also used when you run \"\
          mount -a\" or \"mount  \".\n A typical \"/etc/fstab\" file on a NeCTAR instance\
          \ looks something like this: \n /dev/vda1 /          ext4    defaults  \
          \                           1 1\ntmpfs     /dev/shm   tmpfs   defaults \
          \                            0 0\ndevpts    /dev/pts   devpts  gid=5,mode=620\
          \                       0 0\nsysfs     /sys       sysfs   defaults     \
          \                        0 0\nproc      /proc      proc    defaults    \
          \                         0 0\n/dev/vdb  /mnt       auto    defaults,nofail,comment=cloudconfig\
          \  0 2\n \n Each line describes a file system, and has 6 fields separated\
          \ by spaces\nand tab characters. \n \n Field 1 gives the device or other\
          \ specification for the file\n    system to be mounted. \n Field 2 gives\
          \ the mount point on which the file system should be mounted. \n Field 3\
          \ gives the file system type.  In the example above, \"ext4\" is\n    a\
          \ regular file system format, and the remainder have special meanings. \n\
          \ Field 4 gives any mount options relevant to the mount. \n Field 5 is only\
          \ relevant to the \"dump(8)\" program. \n Field 6 determines the order in\
          \ which (local) file systems are checked\n    by the \"fsck(8)\" program\
          \ at boot time. \n \n To configure a fixed NFS mount, you need to use a\
          \ text editor to edit the\n\"/etc/fstab\" file to add a line that looks\
          \ like this: \n <mount-string> <mount-point> nfs <mount-options> 0 0\n \n\
          \ where the  and  are as above, and the\n directory is a directory that\
          \ you have created using \"mkdir\"\nas mentioned above. \n Once you have\
          \ added the entry, you should run \"sudo mount \"\nor \"sudo mount -a\"\
          \ to mount the NFS file system, and then check that you\ncan read files.\
          \ \n (Note: depending on how the NFS file system was exported, you\nmay\
          \ find that local \"root\" account does not have special privileges on\n\
          the NFS file system; see the section below on \"root squashing\".) \n Configuring\
          \ an NFS automount \n On a modern Linux distro, automounting is handled\
          \ by a service called\n\"autofs\".  This service consults the \"/etc/autofs.master\"\
          \ configuration\nfile to determine where the mount-points should be, and\
          \ then launches\n\"automount\" daemons to control the automatic mounting\
          \ and unmounting. \n The \"autofs\" / \"automount\" mechanisms are highly\
          \ configurable, but we\nrecommend a simple configuration as a starting point.\
          \  Here is a simple\nrecipe: \n \n \n Install the \"autofs\" package (as\
          \ above). \n \n \n Edit the \"/etc/autofs.master\" file, and add the following\
          \ line at\n    the end of the file: \n /- file:/etc/auto.mynfsmounts\n \n\
          \ \n \n Create the \"/etc/auto.mynfsmount\" file, containing the following\n\
          \    line: \n <mount-point> <mount-options> <mount-path>\n \n Where the\
          \ ,  and  are as\nabove. \n \n \n Make sure that the file is only writeable\
          \ by root. \n sudo chown root:root /etc/auto.mynfsmount\n \n sudo chmod\
          \ 644 /etc/auto.mynfsmount \n \n \n Start the \"autofs\" service, using\
          \ your Linux distro's idiom for\n    starting a service; e.g. \n sudo service\
          \ autofs start\n \n or \n sudo systemctl start autofs\n \n \n \n Check that\
          \ the collection mounts: \n $ cd <mount-point>\n \n $ ls -l\n \n \n \n Configure\
          \ the \"autofs\" service to start automatically on system\n    reboot. \n\
          \ sudo chkconfig --add autofs\n \n or \n sudo systemctl enable autofs\n\
          \ \n \n \n Client-side Security and Access Control \n Possibly the most\
          \ difficult aspect of using NFS in the NeCTAR context is\nestablishing who\
          \ is allowed to access the files on the NFS server.  The\nfirst problem\
          \ is ensuring that the client and server sides agree on user\nidentities.\
          \ \n On UNIX / Linux systems, the operating system and the file systems\
          \ use\n\"uids\" (user identifiers) to denote users.  These uids are fundamentally\n\
          just numbers.  The problem is ensuring that the uids are used consistently;\n\
          e.g. that 1001 means the same person, wherever it is used as a uid. \n \n\
          \ \n This is easy to do within a NeCTAR instance. The mapping between the\n\
          \    user accounts are created using \"adduser\", and the uid <-> account\
          \ mapping\n    is represented by the \"/etc/passwd\" file. \n \n \n If you\
          \ are managing a cluster of NeCTAR instances, you create accounts on\n \
          \   one instance and push \"/etc/passwd\" (and the associated \"/etc/shadow\"\
          \n    files) to the other instences.  Alternatively, you can set up an LDAP\n\
          \    server (or similar) that your instances consult to get definitive\n\
          \    information about user identities. \n \n \n Problems arise when you\
          \ are trying to manage a group of instances, where\nthere isn't a shared\
          \ source of user identities.  In such cases, you need\nto arrange that uids\
          \ exposed by the NFS server are meaningful to the\nNFS client(s). \n Note:\
          \ there is a similar mechanism for groups, with uids replaced by gids,\n\
          and \"/etc/passwd\" replaced by \"/etc/groups\". \n Using root access to\
          \ circumvent the problem \n If a user has root access (e.g. via the \"sudo\"\
          \ command) they can circumvent\nnormal file access control, and read or\
          \ write other users' files.  (This is\nnot entirely true if SELinux is used,\
          \ but that is beyond the scope of this\ndocumentation.)  For example: \n\
          \ \n \n Running \"sudo bash\" gives the user a root shell. \n \n \n Running\
          \ \"sudo -u #1234 -g #2345 bash\" gives the user a shell running\n    with\
          \ uid 1234 and gid 2345. \n \n \n This kind of thing will allow you to access\
          \ files on an NFS mounted file\nsystem, provided that the file system has\
          \ not been exported with\n\"root_squash\" or \"all_squash\".  (See below\
          \ for an explanation.) \n Creating access accounts and groups \n One possible\
          \ strategy is to figure out what uids are used on the NFS server,\nand create\
          \ client-side accounts that match them.  This can work as a short\nterm\
          \ solution; e.g. if users can use \"sudo\" to switch identities.  However,\n\
          it is clunky, and if the uids conflict it can be problematic.   \n If you\
          \ want to go down this route, then you need to identify the appropriate\n\
          subset of the uids and gids used on the NFS server, and then create\nmirror\
          \ accounts and groups on the NFS client instance using the \"adduser\"\n\
          or \"useradd\" command and the \"groupadd\" command respectively. \n \n\
          \ \n Use the \"--uid\" and \"--gid\" options to set the same uid and gid\
          \ values\n    that are used on the NFS server. \n \n \n If the uid and gid\
          \ values are already in use on the client, you need\n    to consider whether\
          \ the collision is going to allow one user to access\n    another user's\
          \ files. \n \n \n Mapping identities \n The NFS version 4 allows uids to\
          \ \"name@domain\" strings and back for use in\nNFS requests.  This can be\
          \ used to deal with inconsistent uid <-> account\nname mmapings.  If you\
          \ want / need to do this, you will need to coordinate\nwith the manager\
          \ of the NFS server. \n This deals with the case where the same user (account\
          \ name) or group has\ndifferent uids and gids on the NFS server and client.\
          \  However, it doesn't\ndeal with the case where the same account or group\
          \ name is used for different\nidentities on the server and client.  And\
          \ it doesn't deal with the \"root\"\naccount \n NFS security \n NFS has\
          \ some inherent security issues that the people responsible for\nsetting\
          \ up the NFS server need to understand.  If you are merely using the\nNFS\
          \ server implemented by someone else, then you have to rely on the server\n\
          administrator to address these issues.  However, we mention them here\n\
          because the issues are relevant to you and the people whose data  \n NFS\
          \ client and server host identities \n By default, an NFS server relies\
          \ on IP addresses as the sole means of\ndetermining the identify of NFS\
          \ clients.  This is problematic if other machines\nare able to spoof the\
          \ IP address of a legitimate NFS client.  One way to address\nthis (and\
          \ other security concerns) is to use NFS with Kerberos. \n There is also\
          \ a concern that someone might spoof the IP address\nof the NFS server,\
          \ so that your NeCTAR instance mounts a \"fake\" file\nsystem.  This might\
          \ sound like a strange thing to do, but consider the\ncase where you have\
          \ put user home directories on the NFS server, and\nthe user's home directory\
          \ holds a \".ssh/authorized_keys\" file.  If a\nhacker can cause the client\
          \ NFS to refer to a spoofed file, they can\nopen up a way to login to the\
          \ NFS client instance. \n Aside: unless there is a misconfiguration, it\
          \ should be impossible for\nNeCTAR OpenStack instances to spoof IP addresses\
          \ of other instances.\nHowever, it is not clear if someone outside of your\
          \ data centre might\nbe able to spoof the IP address of an instance, and\
          \ you probably would\nbe vulnerable to spoofing by a non-Openstack host\
          \ in your data centre,\nif such a host was ever compromised. \n Root squashing\
          \ \n The default behavior of an NFS server is to \"squash\" the root account.\n\
          What this does is to cause the NFS server to treate any NFS requests\ncoming\
          \ from the client using the root identity (user 0) as if they\nwere coming\
          \ from the nobody user.  This means that the root user\n(or someone sudo'd\
          \ to root) on the client does not have privileged\naccess to files on the\
          \ mounted file system. \n Generally speaking, root squashing is a sensible\
          \ security measure,\nespecially if local root on the clients cannot always\
          \ be trusted (see\nbelow!).  However, it does not prevent local root from\
          \ assuming the\nidentity of some user, and accessing his / her files that\
          \ way.  In\nfact, the only things that root squashing definitively stops\
          \ are\noperations like \"chown\" that inherently require root privilege.\
          \ \n Note that root squashing is controlled by the NFS export rules on the\n\
          NFS server side. \n Deeper security issues \n By default, NFS protocols\
          \ send data, metadata and requests over the\nnetwork without any encryption.\
          \  If it is possible for a 3rd party\nto run network snooping (packet sniffing)\
          \ software on any intervening\nnetworks, they will be able see the files\
          \ and metadata that is read or\nwritten by your client.  This is one reason\
          \ why it is inadvisable to\nrun NFS over connections that go outside of\
          \ your NeCTAR node's networking\ninfrastructure. \n It is possible to address\
          \ the problem above by using a virtual private\nnetwork (VPN).  The problem\
          \ is that the network traffic needs to be\nencrypted, which impacts the\
          \ performance of NFS running over the VPN. \n A second issue is that the\
          \ NFS file access control model assumes a level\nof trust between people\
          \ with root access to the client and server machines.  If\nthat trust does\
          \ not exist (or is ill-founded) then the end user (the notional\nowner of\
          \ the files) cannot rely on access controls being properly enforced. \n\
          \ The problem is that the group of people with root access can be larger\n\
          than you might expect.  On the client side, it will include: \n \n The person\
          \ who launched the client-side instance, and who we can assume\n    has\
          \ the private key for logging in on the service account. \n Anyone who knows\
          \ the root password (if one has been set) and is a member\n    of the tenant.\
          \ \n Anyone who can legitimately login to the service account, or to any\
          \ other\n    account with sudo access. \n Anyone who has NeCTAR tenant member\
          \ access and can \"rebuild\" the instance. \n Anyone who is able to hack\
          \ into your instance and get root access, or\n    steal credentials for\
          \ the tenant.  \n \n In short, if you are going to enable a NeCTAR instance\
          \ to mount an NFS\nfile system, then the security of the NeCTAR instance\
          \ (the NFS client) and\nthe trustworthiness of the administrators is paramount.\

          <p>NFS (Network File System) is a protocol that allows one Linux or Unix\
          \ system\nto \"mount\" a file system that consists of collection of files\
          \ and directories\nthat are stored on a different system.</p>\n<p>The NFS\
          \ protocol is designed to allow fast access to files over a local area\n\
          network.  It supports the full range of Linux / Unix file system functionality,\n\
          and allows different systems to simultaneously access and update shared\
          \ files\nand directories.</p>\n<p>An NFS file system is \"exported\" by\
          \ a server to one or more client machines.\nThe clients gain access by \"\
          mounting\" the NFS file system within the namespace\nof the client's local\
          \ file system.</p>\n<h2>Prerequisites</h2>\n<p>The following skills and\
          \ privileges are required for the client-side setup.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Basic\
          \ Linux system admin skills.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Root privilege / sudo\
          \ access on the client NeCTAR VM.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition:</p>\n\
          <ul>\n<li>\n<p>You need to know the IP address of the NFS server, and the\
          \ \"mount\n    path\" that identifies the directory tree that you have been\
          \ granted\n    access to.  (The NFS server administrators will typically\
          \ need to\n    enable access to your instance's IP address in the server's\
          \ \"exports\"\n    file.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The NFS server needs to be\
          \ addressible by your client VM at the\n    IP protocol level.  If the NFS\
          \ server has a private IP address, then\n    your client typically needs\
          \ a viable route to that network.  (For\n    QRIScloud, this is achieved\
          \ using the instance's second virtual NIC.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Any firewalls\
          \ need to have been configured to allow NFS traffic on\n    port 111 (TCP\
          \ and UDP) and 2049 (TCP and UDP).  Cluster status\n    requires port 1110\
          \ (TCP), and client status requires port 1110 (UDP), and\n    the NFS lock\
          \ manager requires port 4045 (TCP and UDP).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Installing\
          \ NFS client software</h2>\n<p>Before you attempt to use client-side NFS,\
          \ you need to install some packages\nusing your system's package manager.</p>\n\
          <p>On a Debian, Ubuntu or similar system by running the following commands:</p>\n\
          <p>$ sudo apt-get update\n   $ sudo apt-get install nfs-common autofs</p>\n\
          <p>On RedHat, CentOS or Scientific Linux, run the following:</p>\n<p>$ sudo\
          \ yum install nfs-utils autofs</p>\n<p>On (recent) Fedora, run the following:</p>\n\
          <p>$ sudo dnf install nfs-utils autofs</p>\n<p>(The \"autofs\" package is\
          \ needed if you want to configure the NFS client\nto automount the remote\
          \ file systems.)</p>\n<h2>Configuring the NFS mount</h2>\n<p>There are (at\
          \ least) 3 ways to mount a file system on a remote NFS server</p>\n<ul>\n\
          <li>With a temporary mount, the mount does not survive an instance reboot.</li>\n\
          <li>With a permanent mount, the file system is mounted automatically on\n\
          \    instance startup.</li>\n<li>With an automount, the file system is mounted\
          \ when some program tries\n    to access files, and then unmounted after\
          \ a period of inactivity.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The NFS mount string and options</h3>\n\
          <p>The NFS mount string and mount options are the key pieces of information\n\
          that are needed when an NFS file system is mounted.</p>\n<p>The  specifies\
          \ the remote NFS file system to be mounted\non your client VM.  It consists\
          \ of the NFS server's IP address, and\nan exported NFS path, with a colon\
          \ between them.  For example:</p>\n<pre><code>10.255.120.220:/users/fred\n\
          </code></pre>\n<p>The  determine how the client-side kernel manages\nNFS\
          \ access.  We recommend the following NFS mount options as a\nstarting point:</p>\n\
          <pre><code>rw,hard,intr,nosuid,nodev,timeo=100,retrans=5,nolock\n</code></pre>\n\
          <p>or the following if you need to use NFS version 3:</p>\n<pre><code>rw,nfsvers=3,hard,intr,nosuid,nodev,timeo=100,retrans=5,nolock\n\
          </code></pre>\n<p>The above parameters have the following meanings:</p>\n\
          <ul>\n<li>\n<p>\"rw\" means mount the file system with read-write access.\
          \  An alternative\n    is \"ro\" for read-only access.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\
          <p>\"hard\" instructs the system to attempt to retry \"for ever\" to reconnect\n\
          \    if the client looses its NFS connection.  This is strongly recommended.</p>\n\
          </li>\n<li>\n<p>\"intr\" is a backwards compatibility flag.</p>\n</li>\n\
          <li>\n<p>\"nosuid\" tells the kernel to ignore the \"set user id\" flag\
          \ on executables.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\"nodev\" treats \"device files\"\
          \ as uninterpretted.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the \"timeo\" value is the timeout\
          \ (in 10ths of a second) for NFS\n    request retransmission if the client\
          \ gets no response.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the \"retrans\" value is the number\
          \ of simple retries before the client\n    attempts further recovery actions.</p>\n\
          </li>\n<li>\n<p>\"nolock\" disables file locking on the server.  (If a client-side\
          \ program\n    locks a file, the lock's coverage is limited to just this\
          \ client.)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more details on these and other NFS\
          \ mount parameters, please refer to\n\"man 5 nfs\" and other NFS documentation.</p>\n\
          <h3>The mount point</h3>\n<p>When a Linux (or UNIX) system mounts a file\
          \ system, it mounts it on top\nof an existing directory.  That directory\
          \ is known as the mount point.\nIf you are doing a temporary NFS mount,\
          \ or setting up a permanent mount,\nthe mount point directory needs to be\
          \ created manually.  (If you are\nusing the automount approach, the mount\
          \ point directory can be created\nautomatically.) </p>\n<p>The normal Linux\
          \ convention is to either use \"/mnt\" or a subdirectory\nof \"/mnt\" as\
          \ the mount point.  However NeCTAR VMs use \"/mnt\" as the mount\npoint\
          \ for the (so-called) ephemeral file system.</p>\n<p>You can use the \"\
          mkdir\" command to create the mountpoint directory.  It is\nprobably advisable\
          \ to create it in direcftory that cannot be written by\nunprivileged users.</p>\n\
          <h3>Creating a temporary NFS mount</h3>\n<p>Before you get into the (relative)\
          \ complexity of setting up a permanent\nmount or an automount, it is a good\
          \ idea to check that you can access\nthe NFS server by setting up a temporary\
          \ mount.  You can also use this\napproach for once-off or ad-hoc access\
          \ to NFS.</p>\n<p>The steps are as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Create a\
          \ temporary mount point:</p>\n<pre><code> mkdir ~/tempMount\n</code></pre>\n\
          </li>\n<li>\n<p>Run the mount command:</p>\n<pre><code> sudo mount -t nfs\
          \ -o &lt;mount-options&gt; &lt;mount-string&gt; ~/tempMount\n</code></pre>\n\
          <p>where the  and  are as described above.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Check that\
          \ you can access data on the mounted file system:</p>\n<pre><code> $ ls\
          \ -l ~/tempMount\n &lt;directory listing&gt;\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>\n\
          <p>When you are done, unmount the file system and tidy up the mount point:</p>\n\
          <pre><code> sudo umount ~/tempMount\n</code></pre>\n<p>rmdir ~/tempMount</p>\n\
          <p>Note that the \"umount\" will fail if any process (including as shell)\n\
          \ has files on the mounted file system open, or if it has a directory\n\
          \ in the file system as its current directory.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Configuring\
          \ a fixed NFS mount</h3>\n<p>Fixed mounts are typically configured by adding\
          \ entries to the \"/etc/fstab\"\nfile.  This file is consulted to work out\
          \ which file systems to mount on\nsystem startup.  It is also used when\
          \ you run \"mount -a\" or \"mount </p>\".\n<p>A typical \"/etc/fstab\" file\
          \ on a NeCTAR instance looks something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>/dev/vda1\
          \ /          ext4    defaults                             1 1\ntmpfs   \
          \  /dev/shm   tmpfs   defaults                             0 0\ndevpts \
          \   /dev/pts   devpts  gid=5,mode=620                       0 0\nsysfs \
          \    /sys       sysfs   defaults                             0 0\nproc \
          \     /proc      proc    defaults                             0 0\n/dev/vdb\
          \  /mnt       auto    defaults,nofail,comment=cloudconfig  0 2\n</code></pre>\n\
          <p>Each line describes a file system, and has 6 fields separated by spaces\n\
          and tab characters.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Field 1 gives the device or other specification\
          \ for the file\n    system to be mounted.</li>\n<li>Field 2 gives the mount\
          \ point on which the file system should be mounted.</li>\n<li>Field 3 gives\
          \ the file system type.  In the example above, \"ext4\" is\n    a regular\
          \ file system format, and the remainder have special meanings.</li>\n<li>Field\
          \ 4 gives any mount options relevant to the mount.</li>\n<li>Field 5 is\
          \ only relevant to the \"dump(8)\" program.</li>\n<li>Field 6 determines\
          \ the order in which (local) file systems are checked\n    by the \"fsck(8)\"\
          \ program at boot time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To configure a fixed NFS mount,\
          \ you need to use a text editor to edit the\n\"/etc/fstab\" file to add\
          \ a line that looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;mount-string&gt; &lt;mount-point&gt;\
          \ nfs &lt;mount-options&gt; 0 0\n</code></pre>\n<p>where the  and  are as\
          \ above, and the\n directory is a directory that you have created using\
          \ \"mkdir\"\nas mentioned above.</p>\n<p>Once you have added the entry,\
          \ you should run \"sudo mount \"\nor \"sudo mount -a\" to mount the NFS\
          \ file system, and then check that you\ncan read files.</p>\n<p>(Note: depending\
          \ on how the NFS file system was exported, you\nmay find that local \"root\"\
          \ account does not have special privileges on\nthe NFS file system; see\
          \ the section below on \"root squashing\".)</p>\n<h3>Configuring an NFS\
          \ automount</h3>\n<p>On a modern Linux distro, automounting is handled by\
          \ a service called\n\"autofs\".  This service consults the \"/etc/autofs.master\"\
          \ configuration\nfile to determine where the mount-points should be, and\
          \ then launches\n\"automount\" daemons to control the automatic mounting\
          \ and unmounting.</p>\n<p>The \"autofs\" / \"automount\" mechanisms are\
          \ highly configurable, but we\nrecommend a simple configuration as a starting\
          \ point.  Here is a simple\nrecipe:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Install the \"autofs\"\
          \ package (as above).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Edit the \"/etc/autofs.master\"\
          \ file, and add the following line at\n    the end of the file:</p>\n<pre><code>/-\
          \ file:/etc/auto.mynfsmounts\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Create the\
          \ \"/etc/auto.mynfsmount\" file, containing the following\n    line:</p>\n\
          <pre><code>&lt;mount-point&gt; &lt;mount-options&gt; &lt;mount-path&gt;\n\
          </code></pre>\n<p>Where the ,  and  are as\nabove.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Make\
          \ sure that the file is only writeable by root.</p>\n<pre><code>sudo chown\
          \ root:root /etc/auto.mynfsmount\n</code></pre>\n<p>sudo chmod 644 /etc/auto.mynfsmount</p>\n\
          </li>\n<li>\n<p>Start the \"autofs\" service, using your Linux distro's\
          \ idiom for\n    starting a service; e.g.</p>\n<pre><code>sudo service autofs\
          \ start\n</code></pre>\n<p>or</p>\n<pre><code>sudo systemctl start autofs\n\
          </code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Check that the collection mounts:</p>\n<pre><code>$\
          \ cd &lt;mount-point&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>$ ls -l\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\
          <p>Configure the \"autofs\" service to start automatically on system\n \
          \   reboot.</p>\n<pre><code>sudo chkconfig --add autofs\n</code></pre>\n\
          <p>or</p>\n<pre><code>sudo systemctl enable autofs\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n\
          </ol>\n<h2>Client-side Security and Access Control</h2>\n<p>Possibly the\
          \ most difficult aspect of using NFS in the NeCTAR context is\nestablishing\
          \ who is allowed to access the files on the NFS server.  The\nfirst problem\
          \ is ensuring that the client and server sides agree on user\nidentities.</p>\n\
          <p>On UNIX / Linux systems, the operating system and the file systems use\n\
          \"uids\" (user identifiers) to denote users.  These uids are fundamentally\n\
          just numbers.  The problem is ensuring that the uids are used consistently;\n\
          e.g. that <code>1001</code> means the same person, wherever it is used as\
          \ a uid.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>This is easy to do within a NeCTAR instance.\
          \ The mapping between the\n    user accounts are created using \"adduser\"\
          , and the uid &lt;-&gt; account mapping\n    is represented by the \"/etc/passwd\"\
          \ file.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you are managing a cluster of NeCTAR instances,\
          \ you create accounts on\n    one instance and push \"/etc/passwd\" (and\
          \ the associated \"/etc/shadow\"\n    files) to the other instences.  Alternatively,\
          \ you can set up an LDAP\n    server (or similar) that your instances consult\
          \ to get definitive\n    information about user identities.</p>\n</li>\n\
          </ul>\n<p>Problems arise when you are trying to manage a group of instances,\
          \ where\nthere isn't a shared source of user identities.  In such cases,\
          \ you need\nto arrange that uids exposed by the NFS server are meaningful\
          \ to the\nNFS client(s).</p>\n<p>Note: there is a similar mechanism for\
          \ groups, with uids replaced by gids,\nand \"/etc/passwd\" replaced by \"\
          /etc/groups\".</p>\n<h3>Using root access to circumvent the problem</h3>\n\
          <p>If a user has root access (e.g. via the \"sudo\" command) they can circumvent\n\
          normal file access control, and read or write other users' files.  (This\
          \ is\nnot entirely true if SELinux is used, but that is beyond the scope\
          \ of this\ndocumentation.)  For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Running \"\
          sudo bash\" gives the user a root shell.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Running \"\
          sudo -u #1234 -g #2345 bash\" gives the user a shell running\n    with uid\
          \ 1234 and gid 2345.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This kind of thing will allow\
          \ you to access files on an NFS mounted file\nsystem, provided that the\
          \ file system has not been exported with\n\"root_squash\" or \"all_squash\"\
          .  (See below for an explanation.)</p>\n<h3>Creating access accounts and\
          \ groups</h3>\n<p>One possible strategy is to figure out what uids are used\
          \ on the NFS server,\nand create client-side accounts that match them. \
          \ This can work as a short\nterm solution; e.g. if users can use \"sudo\"\
          \ to switch identities.  However,\nit is clunky, and if the uids conflict\
          \ it can be problematic.  </p>\n<p>If you want to go down this route, then\
          \ you need to identify the appropriate\nsubset of the uids and gids used\
          \ on the NFS server, and then create\nmirror accounts and groups on the\
          \ NFS client instance using the \"adduser\"\nor \"useradd\" command and\
          \ the \"groupadd\" command respectively.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Use the \"\
          --uid\" and \"--gid\" options to set the same uid and gid values\n    that\
          \ are used on the NFS server.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If the uid and gid values\
          \ are already in use on the client, you need\n    to consider whether the\
          \ collision is going to allow one user to access\n    another user's files.</p>\n\
          </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Mapping identities</h3>\n<p>The NFS version 4 allows uids\
          \ to \"name@domain\" strings and back for use in\nNFS requests.  This can\
          \ be used to deal with inconsistent uid &lt;-&gt; account\nname mmapings.\
          \  If you want / need to do this, you will need to coordinate\nwith the\
          \ manager of the NFS server.</p>\n<p>This deals with the case where the\
          \ same user (account name) or group has\ndifferent uids and gids on the\
          \ NFS server and client.  However, it doesn't\ndeal with the case where\
          \ the same account or group name is used for different\nidentities on the\
          \ server and client.  And it doesn't deal with the \"root\"\naccount</p>\n\
          <h2>NFS security</h2>\n<p>NFS has some inherent security issues that the\
          \ people responsible for\nsetting up the NFS server need to understand.\
          \  If you are merely using the\nNFS server implemented by someone else,\
          \ then you have to rely on the server\nadministrator to address these issues.\
          \  However, we mention them here\nbecause the issues are relevant to you\
          \ and the people whose data </p>\n<h3>NFS client and server host identities</h3>\n\
          <p>By default, an NFS server relies on IP addresses as the sole means of\n\
          determining the identify of NFS clients.  This is problematic if other machines\n\
          are able to spoof the IP address of a legitimate NFS client.  One way to\
          \ address\nthis (and other security concerns) is to use NFS with Kerberos.</p>\n\
          <p>There is also a concern that someone might spoof the IP address\nof the\
          \ NFS server, so that your NeCTAR instance mounts a \"fake\" file\nsystem.\
          \  This might sound like a strange thing to do, but consider the\ncase where\
          \ you have put user home directories on the NFS server, and\nthe user's\
          \ home directory holds a \".ssh/authorized_keys\" file.  If a\nhacker can\
          \ cause the client NFS to refer to a spoofed file, they can\nopen up a way\
          \ to login to the NFS client instance.</p>\n<p>Aside: unless there is a\
          \ misconfiguration, it should be impossible for\nNeCTAR OpenStack instances\
          \ to spoof IP addresses of other instances.\nHowever, it is not clear if\
          \ someone outside of your data centre might\nbe able to spoof the IP address\
          \ of an instance, and you probably would\nbe vulnerable to spoofing by a\
          \ non-Openstack host in your data centre,\nif such a host was ever compromised.</p>\n\
          <h3>Root squashing</h3>\n<p>The default behavior of an NFS server is to\
          \ \"squash\" the root account.\nWhat this does is to cause the NFS server\
          \ to treate any NFS requests\ncoming from the client using the root identity\
          \ (user 0) <em>as if</em> they\nwere coming from the <em>nobody</em> user.\
          \  This means that the root user\n(or someone sudo'd to root) on the client\
          \ does not have privileged\naccess to files on the mounted file system.</p>\n\
          <p>Generally speaking, root squashing is a sensible security measure,\n\
          especially if local root on the clients cannot always be trusted (see\n\
          below!).  However, it does not prevent local root from assuming the\nidentity\
          \ of some user, and accessing his / her files that way.  In\nfact, the only\
          \ things that root squashing definitively stops are\noperations like \"\
          chown\" that inherently require root privilege.</p>\n<p>Note that root squashing\
          \ is controlled by the NFS export rules on the\nNFS server side.</p>\n<h3>Deeper\
          \ security issues</h3>\n<p>By default, NFS protocols send data, metadata\
          \ and requests over the\nnetwork without any encryption.  If it is possible\
          \ for a 3rd party\nto run network snooping (packet sniffing) software on\
          \ any intervening\nnetworks, they will be able see the files and metadata\
          \ that is read or\nwritten by your client.  This is one reason why it is\
          \ inadvisable to\nrun NFS over connections that go outside of your NeCTAR\
          \ node's networking\ninfrastructure.</p>\n<p>It is possible to address the\
          \ problem above by using a virtual private\nnetwork (VPN).  The problem\
          \ is that the network traffic needs to be\nencrypted, which impacts the\
          \ performance of NFS running over the VPN.</p>\n<p>A second issue is that\
          \ the NFS file access control model assumes a level\nof trust between people\
          \ with root access to the client and server machines.  If\nthat trust does\
          \ not exist (or is ill-founded) then the end user (the notional\nowner of\
          \ the files) cannot rely on access controls being properly enforced.</p>\n\
          <p>The problem is that the group of people with root access can be larger\n\
          than you might expect.  On the client side, it will include:</p>\n<ul>\n\
          <li>The person who launched the client-side instance, and who we can assume\n\
          \    has the private key for logging in on the service account.</li>\n<li>Anyone\
          \ who knows the root password (if one has been set) and is a member\n  \
          \  of the tenant.</li>\n<li>Anyone who can legitimately login to the service\
          \ account, or to any other\n    account with sudo access.</li>\n<li>Anyone\
          \ who has NeCTAR tenant member access and can \"rebuild\" the instance.</li>\n\
          <li>Anyone who is able to hack into your instance and get root access, or\n\
          \    steal credentials for the tenant. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>In short, if you\
          \ are going to enable a NeCTAR instance to mount an NFS\nfile system, then\
          \ the security of the NeCTAR instance (the NFS client) and\nthe trustworthiness\
          \ of the administrators is paramount.</p>\n<h2>More information</h2>\n<p>There\

  html: "<h1>Mounting NFS file systems on NeCTAR instances</h1>\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\n\
    <p>This document is intended to be a starting point for a NeCTAR VM user who\n\
    wishes to gain access to files stored in an NFS file server.  It does not\ndeal\
    \ with how to set up and secure an NFS file server, or how to set up\nidentity\
    \ management to support per-user access control.</p>\n<p>Note that these instructions\
    \ are intended to be generic.  If you need to\nacccess NFS servers implemented\
    \ by a specific NeCTAR Node operator (for\nexample the QRIScloud RDSI collection\
    \ servers), or virtual laboratory,\ncontact them for any service specific instructions.</p>\n\
    <h2>Background</h2>\n<p>NFS (Network File System) is a protocol that allows one\
    \ Linux or Unix system\nto \"mount\" a file system that consists of collection\
    \ of files and directories\nthat are stored on a different system.</p>\n<p>The\
    \ NFS protocol is designed to allow fast access to files over a local area\nnetwork.\
    \  It supports the full range of Linux / Unix file system functionality,\nand\
    \ allows different systems to simultaneously access and update shared files\n\
    and directories.</p>\n<p>An NFS file system is \"exported\" by a server to one\
    \ or more client machines.\nThe clients gain access by \"mounting\" the NFS file\
    \ system within the namespace\nof the client's local file system.</p>\n<h2>Prerequisites</h2>\n\
    <p>The following skills and privileges are required for the client-side setup.</p>\n\
    <ul>\n<li>\n<p>Basic Linux system admin skills.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Root privilege\
    \ / sudo access on the client NeCTAR VM.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition:</p>\n\
    <ul>\n<li>\n<p>You need to know the IP address of the NFS server, and the \"mount\n\
    \    path\" that identifies the directory tree that you have been granted\n  \
    \  access to.  (The NFS server administrators will typically need to\n    enable\
    \ access to your instance's IP address in the server's \"exports\"\n    file.)</p>\n\
    </li>\n<li>\n<p>The NFS server needs to be addressible by your client VM at the\n\
    \    IP protocol level.  If the NFS server has a private IP address, then\n  \
    \  your client typically needs a viable route to that network.  (For\n    QRIScloud,\
    \ this is achieved using the instance's second virtual NIC.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\
    <p>Any firewalls need to have been configured to allow NFS traffic on\n    port\
    \ 111 (TCP and UDP) and 2049 (TCP and UDP).  Cluster status\n    requires port\
    \ 1110 (TCP), and client status requires port 1110 (UDP), and\n    the NFS lock\
    \ manager requires port 4045 (TCP and UDP).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Installing\
    \ NFS client software</h2>\n<p>Before you attempt to use client-side NFS, you\
    \ need to install some packages\nusing your system's package manager.</p>\n<p>On\
    \ a Debian, Ubuntu or similar system by running the following commands:</p>\n\
    <p>$ sudo apt-get update\n   $ sudo apt-get install nfs-common autofs</p>\n<p>On\
    \ RedHat, CentOS or Scientific Linux, run the following:</p>\n<p>$ sudo yum install\
    \ nfs-utils autofs</p>\n<p>On (recent) Fedora, run the following:</p>\n<p>$ sudo\
    \ dnf install nfs-utils autofs</p>\n<p>(The \"autofs\" package is needed if you\
    \ want to configure the NFS client\nto automount the remote file systems.)</p>\n\
    <h2>Configuring the NFS mount</h2>\n<p>There are (at least) 3 ways to mount a\
    \ file system on a remote NFS server</p>\n<ul>\n<li>With a temporary mount, the\
    \ mount does not survive an instance reboot.</li>\n<li>With a permanent mount,\
    \ the file system is mounted automatically on\n    instance startup.</li>\n<li>With\
    \ an automount, the file system is mounted when some program tries\n    to access\
    \ files, and then unmounted after a period of inactivity.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The\
    \ NFS mount string and options</h3>\n<p>The NFS mount string and mount options\
    \ are the key pieces of information\nthat are needed when an NFS file system is\
    \ mounted.</p>\n<p>The <mount-string> specifies the remote NFS file system to\
    \ be mounted\non your client VM.  It consists of the NFS server's IP address,\
    \ and\nan exported NFS path, with a colon between them.  For example:</p>\n<pre><code>10.255.120.220:/users/fred\n\
    </code></pre>\n<p>The <mount-options> determine how the client-side kernel manages\n\
    NFS access.  We recommend the following NFS mount options as a\nstarting point:</p>\n\
    <pre><code>rw,hard,intr,nosuid,nodev,timeo=100,retrans=5,nolock\n</code></pre>\n\
    <p>or the following if you need to use NFS version 3:</p>\n<pre><code>rw,nfsvers=3,hard,intr,nosuid,nodev,timeo=100,retrans=5,nolock\n\
    </code></pre>\n<p>The above parameters have the following meanings:</p>\n<ul>\n\
    <li>\n<p>\"rw\" means mount the file system with read-write access.  An alternative\n\
    \    is \"ro\" for read-only access.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\"hard\" instructs the\
    \ system to attempt to retry \"for ever\" to reconnect\n    if the client looses\
    \ its NFS connection.  This is strongly recommended.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\"intr\"\
    \ is a backwards compatibility flag.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\"nosuid\" tells the\
    \ kernel to ignore the \"set user id\" flag on executables.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\
    <p>\"nodev\" treats \"device files\" as uninterpretted.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the\
    \ \"timeo\" value is the timeout (in 10ths of a second) for NFS\n    request retransmission\
    \ if the client gets no response.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the \"retrans\" value is\
    \ the number of simple retries before the client\n    attempts further recovery\
    \ actions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\"nolock\" disables file locking on the server.\
    \  (If a client-side program\n    locks a file, the lock's coverage is limited\
    \ to just this client.)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more details on these and other\
    \ NFS mount parameters, please refer to\n\"man 5 nfs\" and other NFS documentation.</p>\n\
    <h3>The mount point</h3>\n<p>When a Linux (or UNIX) system mounts a file system,\
    \ it mounts it on top\nof an existing directory.  That directory is known as the\
    \ mount point.\nIf you are doing a temporary NFS mount, or setting up a permanent\
    \ mount,\nthe mount point directory needs to be created manually.  (If you are\n\
    using the automount approach, the mount point directory can be created\nautomatically.)\
    \ </p>\n<p>The normal Linux convention is to either use \"/mnt\" or a subdirectory\n\
    of \"/mnt\" as the mount point.  However NeCTAR VMs use \"/mnt\" as the mount\n\
    point for the (so-called) ephemeral file system.</p>\n<p>You can use the \"mkdir\"\
    \ command to create the mountpoint directory.  It is\nprobably advisable to create\
    \ it in direcftory that cannot be written by\nunprivileged users.</p>\n<h3>Creating\
    \ a temporary NFS mount</h3>\n<p>Before you get into the (relative) complexity\
    \ of setting up a permanent\nmount or an automount, it is a good idea to check\
    \ that you can access\nthe NFS server by setting up a temporary mount.  You can\
    \ also use this\napproach for once-off or ad-hoc access to NFS.</p>\n<p>The steps\
    \ are as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Create a temporary mount point:</p>\n<pre><code>\
    \ mkdir ~/tempMount\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Run the mount command:</p>\n\
    <pre><code> sudo mount -t nfs -o &lt;mount-options&gt; &lt;mount-string&gt; ~/tempMount\n\
    </code></pre>\n<p>where the <mount-options> and <mount-string> are as described\
    \ above.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Check that you can access data on the mounted file\
    \ system:</p>\n<pre><code> $ ls -l ~/tempMount\n &lt;directory listing&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\
    </li>\n<li>\n<p>When you are done, unmount the file system and tidy up the mount\
    \ point:</p>\n<pre><code> sudo umount ~/tempMount\n</code></pre>\n<p>rmdir ~/tempMount</p>\n\
    <p>Note that the \"umount\" will fail if any process (including as shell)\n has\
    \ files on the mounted file system open, or if it has a directory\n in the file\
    \ system as its current directory.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Configuring a fixed\
    \ NFS mount</h3>\n<p>Fixed mounts are typically configured by adding entries to\
    \ the \"/etc/fstab\"\nfile.  This file is consulted to work out which file systems\
    \ to mount on\nsystem startup.  It is also used when you run \"mount -a\" or \"\
    mount <dir>\".</p>\n<p>A typical \"/etc/fstab\" file on a NeCTAR instance looks\
    \ something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>/dev/vda1 /          ext4    defaults \
    \                            1 1\ntmpfs     /dev/shm   tmpfs   defaults      \
    \                       0 0\ndevpts    /dev/pts   devpts  gid=5,mode=620     \
    \                  0 0\nsysfs     /sys       sysfs   defaults                \
    \             0 0\nproc      /proc      proc    defaults                     \
    \        0 0\n/dev/vdb  /mnt       auto    defaults,nofail,comment=cloudconfig\
    \  0 2\n</code></pre>\n<p>Each line describes a file system, and has 6 fields\
    \ separated by spaces\nand tab characters.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Field 1 gives the device\
    \ or other specification for the file\n    system to be mounted.</li>\n<li>Field\
    \ 2 gives the mount point on which the file system should be mounted.</li>\n<li>Field\
    \ 3 gives the file system type.  In the example above, \"ext4\" is\n    a regular\
    \ file system format, and the remainder have special meanings.</li>\n<li>Field\
    \ 4 gives any mount options relevant to the mount.</li>\n<li>Field 5 is only relevant\
    \ to the \"dump(8)\" program.</li>\n<li>Field 6 determines the order in which\
    \ (local) file systems are checked\n    by the \"fsck(8)\" program at boot time.</li>\n\
    </ul>\n<p>To configure a fixed NFS mount, you need to use a text editor to edit\
    \ the\n\"/etc/fstab\" file to add a line that looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;mount-string&gt;\
    \ &lt;mount-point&gt; nfs &lt;mount-options&gt; 0 0\n</code></pre>\n<p>where the\
    \ <mount-string> and <mount-options> are as above, and the\n<mount-point> directory\
    \ is a directory that you have created using \"mkdir\"\nas mentioned above.</p>\n\
    <p>Once you have added the entry, you should run \"sudo mount <mount-point>\"\n\
    or \"sudo mount -a\" to mount the NFS file system, and then check that you\ncan\
    \ read files.</p>\n<p>(Note: depending on how the NFS file system was exported,\
    \ you\nmay find that local \"root\" account does not have special privileges on\n\
    the NFS file system; see the section below on \"root squashing\".)</p>\n<h3>Configuring\
    \ an NFS automount</h3>\n<p>On a modern Linux distro, automounting is handled\
    \ by a service called\n\"autofs\".  This service consults the \"/etc/autofs.master\"\
    \ configuration\nfile to determine where the mount-points should be, and then\
    \ launches\n\"automount\" daemons to control the automatic mounting and unmounting.</p>\n\
    <p>The \"autofs\" / \"automount\" mechanisms are highly configurable, but we\n\
    recommend a simple configuration as a starting point.  Here is a simple\nrecipe:</p>\n\
    <ol>\n<li>\n<p>Install the \"autofs\" package (as above).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Edit\
    \ the \"/etc/autofs.master\" file, and add the following line at\n    the end\
    \ of the file:</p>\n<pre><code>/- file:/etc/auto.mynfsmounts\n</code></pre>\n\
    </li>\n<li>\n<p>Create the \"/etc/auto.mynfsmount\" file, containing the following\n\
    \    line:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;mount-point&gt; &lt;mount-options&gt; &lt;mount-path&gt;\n\
    </code></pre>\n<p>Where the <mount-point>, <mount-options> and <mount-path> are\
    \ as\nabove.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Make sure that the file is only writeable by\
    \ root.</p>\n<pre><code>sudo chown root:root /etc/auto.mynfsmount\n</code></pre>\n\
    <p>sudo chmod 644 /etc/auto.mynfsmount</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Start the \"autofs\"\
    \ service, using your Linux distro's idiom for\n    starting a service; e.g.</p>\n\
    <pre><code>sudo service autofs start\n</code></pre>\n<p>or</p>\n<pre><code>sudo\
    \ systemctl start autofs\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Check that the collection\
    \ mounts:</p>\n<pre><code>$ cd &lt;mount-point&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>$ ls -l\n\
    <directory listing></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Configure the \"autofs\" service to start\
    \ automatically on system\n    reboot.</p>\n<pre><code>sudo chkconfig --add autofs\n\
    </code></pre>\n<p>or</p>\n<pre><code>sudo systemctl enable autofs\n</code></pre>\n\
    </li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Client-side Security and Access Control</h2>\n<p>Possibly the\
    \ most difficult aspect of using NFS in the NeCTAR context is\nestablishing who\
    \ is allowed to access the files on the NFS server.  The\nfirst problem is ensuring\
    \ that the client and server sides agree on user\nidentities.</p>\n<p>On UNIX\
    \ / Linux systems, the operating system and the file systems use\n\"uids\" (user\
    \ identifiers) to denote users.  These uids are fundamentally\njust numbers. \
    \ The problem is ensuring that the uids are used consistently;\ne.g. that <code>1001</code>\
    \ means the same person, wherever it is used as a uid.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>This\
    \ is easy to do within a NeCTAR instance. The mapping between the\n    user accounts\
    \ are created using \"adduser\", and the uid &lt;-&gt; account mapping\n    is\
    \ represented by the \"/etc/passwd\" file.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you are managing\
    \ a cluster of NeCTAR instances, you create accounts on\n    one instance and\
    \ push \"/etc/passwd\" (and the associated \"/etc/shadow\"\n    files) to the\
    \ other instences.  Alternatively, you can set up an LDAP\n    server (or similar)\
    \ that your instances consult to get definitive\n    information about user identities.</p>\n\
    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Problems arise when you are trying to manage a group of instances,\
    \ where\nthere isn't a shared source of user identities.  In such cases, you need\n\
    to arrange that uids exposed by the NFS server are meaningful to the\nNFS client(s).</p>\n\
    <p>Note: there is a similar mechanism for groups, with uids replaced by gids,\n\
    and \"/etc/passwd\" replaced by \"/etc/groups\".</p>\n<h3>Using root access to\
    \ circumvent the problem</h3>\n<p>If a user has root access (e.g. via the \"sudo\"\
    \ command) they can circumvent\nnormal file access control, and read or write\
    \ other users' files.  (This is\nnot entirely true if SELinux is used, but that\
    \ is beyond the scope of this\ndocumentation.)  For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n\
    <p>Running \"sudo bash\" gives the user a root shell.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Running\
    \ \"sudo -u #1234 -g #2345 bash\" gives the user a shell running\n    with uid\
    \ 1234 and gid 2345.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This kind of thing will allow you to\
    \ access files on an NFS mounted file\nsystem, provided that the file system has\
    \ not been exported with\n\"root_squash\" or \"all_squash\".  (See below for an\
    \ explanation.)</p>\n<h3>Creating access accounts and groups</h3>\n<p>One possible\
    \ strategy is to figure out what uids are used on the NFS server,\nand create\
    \ client-side accounts that match them.  This can work as a short\nterm solution;\
    \ e.g. if users can use \"sudo\" to switch identities.  However,\nit is clunky,\
    \ and if the uids conflict it can be problematic.  </p>\n<p>If you want to go\
    \ down this route, then you need to identify the appropriate\nsubset of the uids\
    \ and gids used on the NFS server, and then create\nmirror accounts and groups\
    \ on the NFS client instance using the \"adduser\"\nor \"useradd\" command and\
    \ the \"groupadd\" command respectively.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Use the \"--uid\"\
    \ and \"--gid\" options to set the same uid and gid values\n    that are used\
    \ on the NFS server.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If the uid and gid values are already\
    \ in use on the client, you need\n    to consider whether the collision is going\
    \ to allow one user to access\n    another user's files.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Mapping\
    \ identities</h3>\n<p>The NFS version 4 allows uids to \"name@domain\" strings\
    \ and back for use in\nNFS requests.  This can be used to deal with inconsistent\
    \ uid &lt;-&gt; account\nname mmapings.  If you want / need to do this, you will\
    \ need to coordinate\nwith the manager of the NFS server.</p>\n<p>This deals with\
    \ the case where the same user (account name) or group has\ndifferent uids and\
    \ gids on the NFS server and client.  However, it doesn't\ndeal with the case\
    \ where the same account or group name is used for different\nidentities on the\
    \ server and client.  And it doesn't deal with the \"root\"\naccount</p>\n<h2>NFS\
    \ security</h2>\n<p>NFS has some inherent security issues that the people responsible\
    \ for\nsetting up the NFS server need to understand.  If you are merely using\
    \ the\nNFS server implemented by someone else, then you have to rely on the server\n\
    administrator to address these issues.  However, we mention them here\nbecause\
    \ the issues are relevant to you and the people whose data </p>\n<h3>NFS client\
    \ and server host identities</h3>\n<p>By default, an NFS server relies on IP addresses\
    \ as the sole means of\ndetermining the identify of NFS clients.  This is problematic\
    \ if other machines\nare able to spoof the IP address of a legitimate NFS client.\
    \  One way to address\nthis (and other security concerns) is to use NFS with Kerberos.</p>\n\
    <p>There is also a concern that someone might spoof the IP address\nof the NFS\
    \ server, so that your NeCTAR instance mounts a \"fake\" file\nsystem.  This might\
    \ sound like a strange thing to do, but consider the\ncase where you have put\
    \ user home directories on the NFS server, and\nthe user's home directory holds\
    \ a \".ssh/authorized_keys\" file.  If a\nhacker can cause the client NFS to refer\
    \ to a spoofed file, they can\nopen up a way to login to the NFS client instance.</p>\n\
    <p>Aside: unless there is a misconfiguration, it should be impossible for\nNeCTAR\
    \ OpenStack instances to spoof IP addresses of other instances.\nHowever, it is\
    \ not clear if someone outside of your data centre might\nbe able to spoof the\
    \ IP address of an instance, and you probably would\nbe vulnerable to spoofing\
    \ by a non-Openstack host in your data centre,\nif such a host was ever compromised.</p>\n\
    <h3>Root squashing</h3>\n<p>The default behavior of an NFS server is to \"squash\"\
    \ the root account.\nWhat this does is to cause the NFS server to treate any NFS\
    \ requests\ncoming from the client using the root identity (user 0) <em>as if</em>\
    \ they\nwere coming from the <em>nobody</em> user.  This means that the root user\n\
    (or someone sudo'd to root) on the client does not have privileged\naccess to\
    \ files on the mounted file system.</p>\n<p>Generally speaking, root squashing\
    \ is a sensible security measure,\nespecially if local root on the clients cannot\
    \ always be trusted (see\nbelow!).  However, it does not prevent local root from\
    \ assuming the\nidentity of some user, and accessing his / her files that way.\
    \  In\nfact, the only things that root squashing definitively stops are\noperations\
    \ like \"chown\" that inherently require root privilege.</p>\n<p>Note that root\
    \ squashing is controlled by the NFS export rules on the\nNFS server side.</p>\n\
    <h3>Deeper security issues</h3>\n<p>By default, NFS protocols send data, metadata\
    \ and requests over the\nnetwork without any encryption.  If it is possible for\
    \ a 3rd party\nto run network snooping (packet sniffing) software on any intervening\n\
    networks, they will be able see the files and metadata that is read or\nwritten\
    \ by your client.  This is one reason why it is inadvisable to\nrun NFS over connections\
    \ that go outside of your NeCTAR node's networking\ninfrastructure.</p>\n<p>It\
    \ is possible to address the problem above by using a virtual private\nnetwork\
    \ (VPN).  The problem is that the network traffic needs to be\nencrypted, which\
    \ impacts the performance of NFS running over the VPN.</p>\n<p>A second issue\
    \ is that the NFS file access control model assumes a level\nof trust between\
    \ people with root access to the client and server machines.  If\nthat trust does\
    \ not exist (or is ill-founded) then the end user (the notional\nowner of the\
    \ files) cannot rely on access controls being properly enforced.</p>\n<p>The problem\
    \ is that the group of people with root access can be larger\nthan you might expect.\
    \  On the client side, it will include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The person who launched\
    \ the client-side instance, and who we can assume\n    has the private key for\
    \ logging in on the service account.</li>\n<li>Anyone who knows the root password\
    \ (if one has been set) and is a member\n    of the tenant.</li>\n<li>Anyone who\
    \ can legitimately login to the service account, or to any other\n    account\
    \ with sudo access.</li>\n<li>Anyone who has NeCTAR tenant member access and can\
    \ \"rebuild\" the instance.</li>\n<li>Anyone who is able to hack into your instance\
    \ and get root access, or\n    steal credentials for the tenant. </li>\n</ul>\n\
    <p>In short, if you are going to enable a NeCTAR instance to mount an NFS\nfile\
    \ system, then the security of the NeCTAR instance (the NFS client) and\nthe trustworthiness\
    \ of the administrators is paramount.</p>\n<h2>More information</h2>\n<p>There\

        desc_un_html: " Introduction to Networking \n Ethernet \n Ethernet is the\
          \ most common network protocol used in the local area network (LAN) and\n\
          it is specified by the IEEE 802.3 standard. Ethernet operates in the second\
          \ layer\nin the OSI model of networking protocols. \n Hosts communicate\
          \ by exchanging frames in a Ethernet network and each host is uniquely\n\
          identified by an media access control(MAC) address. In NecTAR Cloud, every\
          \ virtual\nmachine has a unique MAC address and it is different from the\
          \ MAC address of the\nhost machine. The MAC address contains 48 bits and\
          \ looks like 02:03:22:a2:c2:33.\nA host in a Ethernet network can communicate\
          \ with each other by using the MAC address.\nA host can also sent a frame\
          \ to all hosts (broadcast) in the same Ethernet network\nby using MAC address\
          \ ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff.  \n When a host receives a Ethernet frame, it checks\
          \ its destination MAC address and\nsee whether it matches its own MAC address.\
          \ If it matches, the host receives the\nframe and if it doesn't, the host\
          \ just simply drop the frame. \n VLAN \n In Ethernet network, every hosts\
          \ share the same network segment and therefore share\nthe same network traffic.\
          \ However, it is useful to divide hosts into different groups\nin order\
          \ to isolate the network traffic and also for better management. \n VLAN\
          \ is the technology to enable grouping of hosts in a Ethernet network and\
          \ each\nhost can only see traffic within the group. Specifically, hosts\
          \ can be grouped by\nVLANs and they cannot see traffic on different VLANs.In\
          \ NecTAR Cloud, virtual\nmachines can also take advantages to isolate the\
          \ traffic among them. Even the virtual\nmachines are on the same hosts.\
          \ By creating a VLAN, each VLAN is identified by an\nunique ID, between\
          \ 1 and 4095. \n VLAN can be implemented by assign a switch port to a VLAN\
          \ Id to only allow traffic\nfrom that VLAN to pass through that port or\
          \ by assigning a tag to Ethernet Frame\nto allow frames are only pass through\
          \ based on the same tag. \n IP \n Ethernet specifies how hosts can communicate\
          \ in local area networks and there are\nneeds to interconnect multiple Ethernet\
          \ networks. The Internet Protocol (IP)\ndefines how packets (encapsulated\
          \ frames) can travel between hosts that are connected\nto different local\
          \ networks. The IP protocol defines IP addresses to uniquely identify\n\
          a host and IP address is 32 bits (IP version 4) and looks like 10.10.12.123.\
          \ To\nmake this work, IP replies on routers or gateways. A router is a device\
          \ that connects\ntwo or more local networks and can forward packets from\
          \ one network to another.\nRouter operates in layer 3 in the OSI model of\
          \ networking protocols. \n Before sending a packet, a host checks its routing\
          \ table to find out any hosts\nin the local network matches the IP address.\
          \ The routing table maintains a list of\nsubnets as well as a list of routers\
          \ in the local network. \n If no IP matches in the local network, packets\
          \ are forwarded to the default router\n(default gateway). \n Subnets \n\
          \ IP addresses (IP version 4) are 32 bits and contains 2 parts: a network\
          \ number\nand a host identifier. If two hosts have the same network number,\
          \ then they are\non the same network and can communicate with each other\
          \ directly without routers\n(same as they are on the Ethernet network).\
          \ \n To get the network part of a IP address, netmask is used. A netmask\
          \ indicates\nhow many bits in the IP address make up the network part. The\
          \ network part of\na IP address can be 8, 16, 24 bits. For example, consider\
          \ an IP address of\n192.168.1.1, where the first 24 bits of the address\
          \ are the network number. In\ndotted quad notation, the netmask would be\
          \ written as 255.255.255.0 and the network\nnumber is 192.168.1.0. \n DHCP\
          \ \n DHCP defines how hosts can dynamically obtain IP addresses. A DHCP\
          \ server assign\nIP addresses to hosts, which are the DHCP clients. \n Ports\
          \ \n As there are many applications can be run on a host, ports are used\
          \ to identify\nwhich application should receive packages when packet have\
          \ been received on\nthe host. When a host sending a packet to a remote host,\
          \ it needs to specify the\nport number for the destination host to use.\
          \ Port numbers range from 0 to 65525.\nPort numbers from 0 to 1-24 are reserved\
          \ for well-known services such as port 22\nfor SSH service. \n Network Components\
          \ \n NICs and VNICs \n Network Interface Card (NIC) is a physical card that\
          \ enables computers to connect\nto network. It has a unique MAC address\
          \ associated with it and a port allows\na physical capable to connect to\
          \ it. A VNIC is a virtualized network interface card,\nused by a virtual\
          \ machine as its network interface. A VNIC also has a MAC address\nassociated\
          \ with it. However, this MAC address not same as the MAC address binded\n\
          with NIC and it depends on the Hypervisor or a virtual machine service provider.\n\
          A VNIC is created when a virtual machine is created. \n Switches \n A switch\
          \ is a network device that connects other network devices such as NICs or\n\
          another switch. It contains multiple ports and forward data frame among\
          \ devices\nconnected via the ports. Switches operate at layer 2 in a OSI\
          \ model. \n Routers \n A router is a network device that connects multiple\
          \ local networks together. When\nit receives a data packet, it uses a routing\
          \ table to determine which networks\nto pass the data packet to. \n Network\
          \ address translation (NAT) \n NAT is a process of changing the source or\
          \ destination IP address of a IP packet when\nthe packet is in transit.\
          \ NAT is commonly used to enables hosts with private addresses\nto communicate\
          \ with servers on the public Internet. OpenStack uses NAT to enable\napplications\
          \ running inside of virtual machines to connect out to the public Internet.\
          \ \n Introduction to OpenStack Networking (Neutron) \n The OpenStack Network\
          \ service (Neutron) provides network connectivity and addressing\nin the\
          \ NeCTAR Cloud. It handles the creation and management of a virtual network\n\
          infrastructure, including networks, switches, subnets and routers for virtual\
          \ machines. \n OpenStack Compute(nova) uses Neutron to plug each virtual\
          \ NIC on the virtual machine\ninto a network. Users can also OpenStack dashboard(horizon)\
          \ to create and manage\nnetwork services through a web-based graphical interface.\
          \ \n Network Types \n There are three supported networks in Neutron. External\
          \ network, provider network\nand tenant network. \n External Network \n\
          \ External network is a Internet routable network, which is the physical\
          \ network that\nconnects the network node to Internet via a router or firewall.\
          \ \n Provider Network \n Provider network is created by cloud administrator\
          \ and it is mapped to the external\nnetwork and run top of the external\
          \ network. The physical NICs on compute nodes\nare connected to physical\
          \ switch ports, which are configured as a trunk containing\nall of the VLANs\
          \ in the environment.Provder networks are created mapping to the\ndifferent\
          \ VLANs in the trunk. After virtual machine is created, the provider network\n\
          can be attached to the virtual machine and a IP address associated with\
          \ the VLAN\nwill be assigned to VNIC on the virtual machine. Therefore,\
          \ the instances can\nbegin to communicate. \n Tenant Network \n Tenant network\
          \ is provisioned by users and isolated from other tenants(projects) and\n\
          it functions as a user created VLAN and can be utilized based on users'\
          \ requirements.\nIt can be configured to connect to virtual machines in\
          \ other tenants and\nprovider networks (Internet access) via a Neutron L3\
          \ router. Virtual machines can\nbe attached to provider network directly\
          \ without the need of tenant network. \n Components \n The Network service\
          \ consists of a server, a database, and a number of plug-in agents,\nwhich\
          \ provide various networking functions such as layer 2 (Ethernet and Switching)\n\
          and layer 3 (IP and Routing) connectivity. It also provides some high level\
          \ network\nservices such as firewall and virtual private networks. \n Server\
          \ \n Neutron server provides a web server that supports the Neutroin API\
          \ and it also\npass the API calls to the Neutron plugins for processing.\
          \ Plugins to communicate\nwith the agents for processing the It also manages\
          \ the database to persist metadata.  \n Plugins \n Plugins allow function\
          \ extension or customization of existing functions in Neutron.\nPeople can\
          \ develop plugins for providing customized networking functions and resources\n\
          to virtual machines. \n Agents \n The agents implement specific networking\

          <p>If no IP matches in the local network, packets are forwarded to the default
          router

          (default gateway).</p>

          <h3>Subnets</h3>

          <p>IP addresses (IP version 4) are 32 bits and contains 2 parts: a network

          <h3>NICs and VNICs</h3>

          <p>Network Interface Card (NIC) is a physical card that enables computers
          to connect

          to network. It has a unique MAC address associated with it and a port allows

          card,

          used by a virtual machine as its network interface. A VNIC also has a MAC
          address

          associated with it. However, this MAC address not same as the MAC address
          binded

          with NIC and it depends on the Hypervisor or a virtual machine service provider.

          A VNIC is created when a virtual machine is created.</p>

          <h4>Switches</h4>

          <p>A switch is a network device that connects other network devices such

          <p>The OpenStack Network service (Neutron) provides network connectivity
          and addressing

          in the NeCTAR Cloud. It handles the creation and management of a virtual

          network services through a web-based graphical interface.</p>

          <h3>Network Types</h3>

          <p>There are three supported networks in Neutron. External network, provider
          network

          and tenant network.</p>

          <h4>External Network</h4>

          <p>External network is a Internet routable network, which is the physical
          network that

          connects the network node to Internet via a router or firewall.</p>

          <h4>Provider Network</h4>

          <p>Provider network is created by cloud administrator and it is mapped to
          the external

          network and run top of the external network. The physical NICs on compute
          nodes

          are connected to physical switch ports, which are configured as a trunk
          containing

          all of the VLANs in the environment.Provder networks are created mapping
          to the

          different VLANs in the trunk. After virtual machine is created, the provider
          network

          can be attached to the virtual machine and a IP address associated with
          the VLAN

          will be assigned to VNIC on the virtual machine. Therefore, the instances
          can

          begin to communicate.</p>

          <h4>Tenant Network</h4>

          <p>Tenant network is provisioned by users and isolated from other tenants(projects)
          and

          it functions as a user created VLAN and can be utilized based on users''
          requirements.

          It can be configured to connect to virtual machines in other tenants and

          provider networks (Internet access) via a Neutron L3 router. Virtual machines
          can

          be attached to provider network directly without the need of tenant network.</p>

          <h3>Components</h3>

          <p>The Network service consists of a server, a database, and a number of
          plug-in agents,

          which provide various networking functions such as layer 2 (Ethernet and

    <h3>Ethernet</h3>

    <p>Ethernet is the most common network protocol used in the local area network
    (LAN) and

    it is specified by the IEEE 802.3 standard. Ethernet operates in the second layer

    in the OSI model of networking protocols.</p>

    <p>Hosts communicate by exchanging frames in a Ethernet network and each host
    is uniquely

    identified by an media access control(MAC) address. In NecTAR Cloud, every virtual

    machine has a unique MAC address and it is different from the MAC address of the

    host machine. The MAC address contains 48 bits and looks like 02:03:22:a2:c2:33.

    A host in a Ethernet network can communicate with each other by using the MAC
    address.

    A host can also sent a frame to all hosts (broadcast) in the same Ethernet network

    by using MAC address ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff. </p>

    <p>When a host receives a Ethernet frame, it checks its destination MAC address
    and

    see whether it matches its own MAC address. If it matches, the host receives the

    frame and if it doesn''t, the host just simply drop the frame.</p>

    <h3>VLAN</h3>

    <p>In Ethernet network, every hosts share the same network segment and therefore
    share

    the same network traffic. However, it is useful to divide hosts into different
    groups

    in order to isolate the network traffic and also for better management.</p>

    <p>VLAN is the technology to enable grouping of hosts in a Ethernet network and
    each

    host can only see traffic within the group. Specifically, hosts can be grouped
    by

    VLANs and they cannot see traffic on different VLANs.In NecTAR Cloud, virtual

    machines can also take advantages to isolate the traffic among them. Even the
    virtual

    machines are on the same hosts. By creating a VLAN, each VLAN is identified by
    an

    unique ID, between 1 and 4095.</p>

    <p>VLAN can be implemented by assign a switch port to a VLAN Id to only allow
    traffic

    from that VLAN to pass through that port or by assigning a tag to Ethernet Frame

    to allow frames are only pass through based on the same tag.</p>

    <h3>IP</h3>

    <p>Ethernet specifies how hosts can communicate in local area networks and there
    are

    needs to interconnect multiple Ethernet networks. The Internet Protocol (IP)

    defines how packets (encapsulated frames) can travel between hosts that are connected

    to different local networks. The IP protocol defines IP addresses to uniquely
    identify

    a host and IP address is 32 bits (IP version 4) and looks like 10.10.12.123. To

    make this work, IP replies on routers or gateways. A router is a device that connects

    two or more local networks and can forward packets from one network to another.

    Router operates in layer 3 in the OSI model of networking protocols.</p>

    <p>Before sending a packet, a host checks its routing table to find out any hosts

    in the local network matches the IP address. The routing table maintains a list
    of

    subnets as well as a list of routers in the local network.</p>

    <p>If no IP matches in the local network, packets are forwarded to the default
    router

    (default gateway).</p>

    <h3>Subnets</h3>

    <p>IP addresses (IP version 4) are 32 bits and contains 2 parts: a network number

    and a host identifier. If two hosts have the same network number, then they are

    on the same network and can communicate with each other directly without routers

    (same as they are on the Ethernet network).</p>

    <p>To get the network part of a IP address, netmask is used. A netmask indicates

    how many bits in the IP address make up the network part. The network part of

    a IP address can be 8, 16, 24 bits. For example, consider an IP address of

    192.168.1.1, where the first 24 bits of the address are the network number. In

    dotted quad notation, the netmask would be written as 255.255.255.0 and the network

    number is 192.168.1.0.</p>

    <h3>DHCP</h3>

    <p>DHCP defines how hosts can dynamically obtain IP addresses. A DHCP server assign

    IP addresses to hosts, which are the DHCP clients.</p>

    <h3>Ports</h3>

    <p>As there are many applications can be run on a host, ports are used to identify

    which application should receive packages when packet have been received on

    the host. When a host sending a packet to a remote host, it needs to specify the

    port number for the destination host to use. Port numbers range from 0 to 65525.

    Port numbers from 0 to 1-24 are reserved for well-known services such as port
    22

    for SSH service.</p>

    <h3>Network Components</h3>

    <h3>NICs and VNICs</h3>

    <p>Network Interface Card (NIC) is a physical card that enables computers to connect

    to network. It has a unique MAC address associated with it and a port allows

    a physical capable to connect to it. A VNIC is a virtualized network interface
    card,

    used by a virtual machine as its network interface. A VNIC also has a MAC address

    associated with it. However, this MAC address not same as the MAC address binded

    with NIC and it depends on the Hypervisor or a virtual machine service provider.

    A VNIC is created when a virtual machine is created.</p>

    <h4>Switches</h4>

    <p>A switch is a network device that connects other network devices such as NICs
    or

    another switch. It contains multiple ports and forward data frame among devices

    connected via the ports. Switches operate at layer 2 in a OSI model.</p>

    <h4>Routers</h4>

    <p>A router is a network device that connects multiple local networks together.
    When

    it receives a data packet, it uses a routing table to determine which networks

    to pass the data packet to.</p>

    <h3>Network address translation (NAT)</h3>

    <p>NAT is a process of changing the source or destination IP address of a IP packet
    when

    the packet is in transit. NAT is commonly used to enables hosts with private addresses

    to communicate with servers on the public Internet. OpenStack uses NAT to enable

    applications running inside of virtual machines to connect out to the public Internet.</p>

    <h2>Introduction to OpenStack Networking (Neutron)</h2>

    <p>The OpenStack Network service (Neutron) provides network connectivity and addressing

    in the NeCTAR Cloud. It handles the creation and management of a virtual network

    infrastructure, including networks, switches, subnets and routers for virtual
    machines.</p>

    <p>OpenStack Compute(nova) uses Neutron to plug each virtual NIC on the virtual
    machine

    into a network. Users can also OpenStack dashboard(horizon) to create and manage

    network services through a web-based graphical interface.</p>

    <h3>Network Types</h3>

    <p>There are three supported networks in Neutron. External network, provider network

    and tenant network.</p>

    <h4>External Network</h4>

    <p>External network is a Internet routable network, which is the physical network
    that

    connects the network node to Internet via a router or firewall.</p>

    <h4>Provider Network</h4>

    <p>Provider network is created by cloud administrator and it is mapped to the
    external

    network and run top of the external network. The physical NICs on compute nodes

    are connected to physical switch ports, which are configured as a trunk containing

    all of the VLANs in the environment.Provder networks are created mapping to the

    different VLANs in the trunk. After virtual machine is created, the provider network

    can be attached to the virtual machine and a IP address associated with the VLAN

    will be assigned to VNIC on the virtual machine. Therefore, the instances can

    begin to communicate.</p>

    <h4>Tenant Network</h4>

    <p>Tenant network is provisioned by users and isolated from other tenants(projects)
    and

    it functions as a user created VLAN and can be utilized based on users'' requirements.

    It can be configured to connect to virtual machines in other tenants and

    provider networks (Internet access) via a Neutron L3 router. Virtual machines
    can

    be attached to provider network directly without the need of tenant network.</p>

    <h3>Components</h3>

    <p>The Network service consists of a server, a database, and a number of plug-in
    agents,

    which provide various networking functions such as layer 2 (Ethernet and Switching)

    and layer 3 (IP and Routing) connectivity. It also provides some high level network

    services such as firewall and virtual private networks.</p>

    <h3>Server</h3>

    <p>Neutron server provides a web server that supports the Neutroin API and it
    also

    pass the API calls to the Neutron plugins for processing. Plugins to communicate

    with the agents for processing the It also manages the database to persist metadata.
    </p>

    <h3>Plugins</h3>

    <p>Plugins allow function extension or customization of existing functions in
    Neutron.

    People can develop plugins for providing customized networking functions and resources

    to virtual machines.</p>

    <h3>Agents</h3>

    <p>The agents implement specific networking functions and communicate with the
    Neutron

    server and the plugins on the server. The example agent is Layer 2 agent that
    runs

    on the compute node (nova). The agent handles all layer 2 networking functions
    in

    the OSI model and provide network connectivity to virtual machines.  </p>

    <h3>Services</h3>

    <p>Neutron provides some pre-existing high level network services such as VPN,
    firewall

    and load balancer.</p>

    <h2>Network node</h2>

    <p>It is the host where L3 agent and DHCP agent running. It manages layer 3 networking

    functions such as router between different VLANS.</p>
