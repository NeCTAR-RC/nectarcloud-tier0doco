          \ a Security Group \n Example - launching an instance \n \n This guide describes\
          \ launching a running instance (virtual machine) with SSH login\nenabled.\
          \ \n Setting up and using the Virtual Machines requires at least some familiarity\
          \ with\nUNIX shell (often called 'BASH') commands. There are many excellent\
          \ beginner's \ntutorials to refresh your skills, such as this short, interactive\
          \ tutorial from\nCodecademy. \n Preparation - creating an SSH keypair \n\
          \ \n You need to create a public/private key pair before you can use SSH\
          \ to login to \nthe newly created instance. The public key will be stored\
          \ on the instance and\nthe private key is used on your desktop/laptop. \
          \ \n \n Keys can be created by your computer, and the public key uploaded\
          \ to Nectar, or  \n Keys can be created on the Nectar dashboard, and the\
          \ private key downloaded to your computer. \n \n 1. Create a keypair locally\
          \ \n Windows User \n On Windows computers, the program PuTTY is used as\
          \ an SSH client and a terminal emulator.\nPutty allows the windows user\
          \ to access and use the VM via the command line.\nUse PuTTYgen key generator\
          \ to generate the required key pair: \n \n \n Download PuTTYgen (puttygen.exe)\
          \ from PuTTYgen download page\n \n Launch the PuTTYgen application by double\
          \ clicking the puttygen.exe\n \n The default settings are fine for this\
          \ case, click the 'Generate' button \n Save your public key by clicking\
          \ 'Save public key' button. You should give a\n name that will help identify\
          \ the key in the future \n Save your private key by clicking 'Save private\
          \ key' button. You should give\n a sensible name for future reference. The\
          \ passphrase can provide additional\n security, though can be left empty.\
          \ \n \n \n Linux/Mac User \n On Mac and Linux computers, commands are entered\
          \ directly in the 'Terminal' application. \n ssh-keygen -t rsa -f Nectar_Key\
          \ \n \n To generate a keypair, enter the previous command in the Terminal.\
          \ \n Instead of \"Nectar_Key\", enter your preferred key name. \n By default,\
          \ key files will be generated in the directory '~/.ssh'. Check with ls ~/.ssh\n\
          \ \n You should see a private key (e.g. 'Nectar_Key') and a public key (e.g.\
          \ 'Nectar_Key.pub') \n \n Note: For the security of your private key, ensuring\
          \ only the user can read the file:\nOn you local computer, enter chmod 600\
          \ ~/.ssh/Nectar_Key. \n \n Import the Public Key to Nectar \n The public\
          \ key generated by Windows/Linux/Mac are required to be imported into\n\
          the Nectar Cloud dashboard before use. \n \n   \n \n Log into the Cloud\
          \ Dashboard\n \n Go to the 'Access and Security' tab and then to the 'Keypairs'\
          \ page \n Click 'Import Key Pair' button \n \n Type in a keypair name and\
          \ paste the contents of the public key.  \n \n \n For Windows users, open\
          \ PuTTYgen and click 'Load' button to load the related private key and copy/paste\
          \ the public key contents. \n \n For Linux/Mac user, type cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\
          \ and copy/paste the public key contents from the terminal output. \n \n\
          \ 2. Alternatively: Create Keys on the Nectar Cloud Dashboard \n \n \n Login\
          \ to the Cloud Dashboard\n \n Go to the Access and Security tab and then\
          \ to the Keypairs page \n Click the 'Create Key Pair' button \n Type in\
          \ a keypair name in the popup window and click the 'Create Key Pair'\n button.\
          \ The private key will be downloaded. \n Save the private key into a directory\
          \ on your local computer. \n \n \n Mac / Linux \n mv ~/Downloads/Nectar_Key.pem\
          \ ~/.ssh/Nectar_Key This moves the private key to \nthe '.ssh' folder (change\
          \ 'Nectar_Key' to the name of your keypair). \n Note: For the security of\
          \ your private key, ensuring only the user can read the file:\nOn you local\
          \ computer, enter chmod 600 ~/.ssh/Nectar_Key.  \n \n Windows \n The SSH\
          \ private key will need to be converted for use with PuTTY. \n \n Open PuTTYgen\
          \ \n Click 'Load' button to load the private key generated by the Cloud\
          \ Dashboard \n Click 'Export OpenSSH key' from 'Conversions' menu \n Type\
          \ a private key name and save \n \n   \n \n For more information, you can\
          \ access the detailed SSH key tutorial page. \n \n Select an Image \n You\
          \ need to select an image to be used for your instance. The image defines\
          \ what\noperating system the instance uses and thus you need to select an\
          \ image based on\nyour needs. Nectar Cloud offers a list of official images\
          \ and for\nsimplicity, these images are recommended. You can find a complete\
          \ list of\nofficial images from Nectar image catalog. You can also find\
          \ all\navailable images from the Cloud Dashboard. \n \n Login to the Cloud\
          \ Dashboard\n \n Go to the Dashboard 'Images' tab \n \n For advanced users,\
          \ you can also create your own images. Please refer to\nthe openstack documentation\
          \ for more details. \n Configure Instance \n \n Before you can launch an\
          \ instance, you need to configure the following options: \n Details \n \n\
          \ \n Instance Name: the name used by the dashboard to identify the instance\
          \ \n \n \n Flavour: the resources available for the instance. It specifies\
          \ the number of\n VCPUs, size of root disk, size of ephemeral disk and size\
          \ of RAM.\n Your allocated flavour or lesser configurations can be selected\
          \ (the\n default is m2.tiny; a 1 VCPU machine) \n \n \n Instance Count:\
          \ number of instance to launch (the default is 1) \n \n \n Instance Boot\
          \ Source: the media used to boot the instance. You can boot from\n image,\
          \ snapshot and volume (the default is boot from image) \n \n \n Boot from\
          \ image: Boot instance using an image \n \n Boot from snapshot: Boot instance\
          \ using a snapshot \n \n Boot from volume: Boot instance from volume storage\
          \ \n \n \n Image Name: the name of an Image. This option is used when the\
          \ Instance Boot\n Source is 'Boot from image' \n \n \n Access & Security\
          \ \n \n \n Key Pair: the public/private keys used to log into the instance.\
          \ See above to\n see how to create them. This can't be added or changed\
          \ after the instance is\n created. \n \n \n Security Groups: add network\
          \ access to your instances. This determines what\n services can be accessed\
          \ on the instance. You must select 'SSH' Security Groups\n to allow you\
          \ to login via SSH. If 'SSH' Security Groups is not available, you\n can\
          \ create it by going to Access & Security tab on the right hand side of\
          \ the\n Cloud Dashboard. The default Security Group (no network access at\
          \ first) is\n pre-selected \n \n \n To create a Security Group \n \n \n\
          \ Login to the Cloud Dashboard\n \n Go to the Access & Security tab \n Click\
          \ 'Create Security Group' button \n Give a name for the Security Group \n\
          \ Give a meaningful description for the Security Group \n Click 'Create\
          \ Security Group' button \n \n The newly created Security Group has no rules\
          \ added (no network access defined).\nTo add rules to a Security Group:\
          \ \n \n Go to the Access & Security tab \n Tick to select the Security Group\
          \ to add rules \n Click 'Manage Rules' button \n Click 'Add Rule' button\
          \ \n Select what type of Rule you want to create \n Select from 'Open Port'\
          \ the 'Port' option to open one single port, or 'Port Range'\n to open a\
          \ range of ports \n The 'Remote' option specifies the source of the traffic\
          \ to be allowed via this\n rule. You may do so either in the form of an\
          \ IP address block (CIDR) or via a\n source group (Security Group). \n Click\
          \ 'Add' button \n \n You can also click 'Delete Rule' button to delete a\
          \ rule \n Availability Zone \n Select the Availability Zone for your instance.\
          \ The Availability Zone is the\nlocation for your instance. By default,\
          \ the system will select an available\nlocation for you. You can also click\
          \ the 'Advanced' button to select from a\ncomplete list of available Availability\
          \ Zones \n Post-Creation \n You can execute a customization script after\
          \ you launch your instance. You can\ndo any initialization and customization\
          \ to your instance by using this and it\nis executed only once at the first\
          \ boot of your instance. You can copy/paste\nyour script by selecting 'Direct\
          \ Input' or you can upload a script file. The\nscript can be a shell script\
          \ or Cloud-init script. \n Advanced Options \n You can choose whether you\
          \ automaticly or manually create the disk partition.\nIn most cases, you\
          \ shouldn't change the default. \n Notes: The above configuration options\
          \ can be set in the 'Launch Instance' popup\nwindow. To launch the popup\
          \ window, you can go to the Instances tab and\nclick 'Launch Instance' button.\
          \ \n To get more information about the terms used, please refer to\nthe\
          \ Glossary. \n \n Example Launch of an Instance \n \n \n \n Login to the\
          \ Cloud Dashboard\n \n Go to Dashboard Instances tab \n Click 'Launch Instance'\
          \ button \n Type instance name \n Select a flavour. Flavour indicates the\
          \ specification of a instance. You can find more information in the Flavour\
          \ Details. \n Select an NeCTAR offical image (we suggest selecting an Ubuntu\
          \ image such as NeCTAR Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty) amd64) \n \n \n \n Click Access\
          \ & Security tab \n Select a key pair created earlier \n Select security\
          \ groups to use. Tick 'ssh' and 'http' (these are pre-defined groups in\
          \ the default personal project) \n \n \n \n Click Availability Zone \n Select\
          \ the location of your instance or leave as unselected (the system will\
          \ auto select available location) \n Click launch button and the page will\
          \ change to the Instances Tab \n After a while (usually a couple of minutes),\
          \ your instance will become active\n and will have an IP address. The IP\
          \ address is available in the Instances table\n on your Nectar Dashboard.\
          \ \n \n The launch button begins Cloud provisioning and initialisation of\
          \ a running\ninstance from the selected image and your configuration options.\
          \ The instance\nwill normally pass from status \"Build\" to \"Active\".\
          \ Depending on your image\nsize and cloud activity, the length of time required\
          \ may vary. Your instance\nwill have a public IP address and be reachable\
          \ according to the\nSecurity Groups selected. \n Instructions to access\
          \ the instance are on the 'Accessing Instance' page in Cloud Basics. \n\
          \ If Launch is Unsuccessful \n You may get a message that your quota has\
          \ been exceeded or you have\ninsufficient resources. Check the table to\
          \ the right on the Launch Instance page\nfor the number of instances you\
          \ may run simultaneously, then check the\nInstances tab to see how many\
          \ Instances you already have running. You may have\nto terminate a running\
          \ Instance to free resources before you can launch another\n(see Instance\
          \ tab to Terminate). If you need more resources see the allocation\ntab\
          \ to apply for an increase. \n If the above doesn't apply to you, alternatively,\
          \ you can send an email to the\nCloud Help Desk. Please find how to lodge\
          \ a support ticket from\nNectar Support. "

    \ (virtual machine) with SSH login\nenabled.</p>\n<p>Setting up and using the\
    \ Virtual Machines requires at least some familiarity with\nUNIX shell (often\
    \ called 'BASH') commands. There are many excellent beginner's \ntutorials to\
    \ refresh your skills, such as this short, interactive tutorial from\n<a href=\"\
    https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line\">Codecademy</a>.</p>\n\
    <h2>Preparation - creating an SSH keypair <a name=\"Keypair\"></a></h2>\n<p>You\
    \ need to create a public/private key pair before you can use SSH to login to\
    \ \nthe newly created instance. The public key will be stored on the instance\
    \ and\nthe private key is used on your desktop/laptop. </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Keys can\
    \ be created by your computer, and the public key uploaded to Nectar, or </li>\n\
    <li>Keys can be created on the Nectar dashboard, and the private key downloaded\
    \ to your computer.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>1. Create a keypair locally</h2>\n<h3>Windows\
    \ User</h3>\n<p>On Windows computers, the program PuTTY is used as an SSH client\
    \ and a terminal emulator.\nPutty allows the windows user to access and use the\
    \ VM via the command line.\nUse PuTTYgen key generator to generate the required\
    \ key pair:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"puttygen1\" src=\"https://github.com/NeCTAR-RC/nectarcloud-tier0doco/blob/master/articles/NeCTAR\

    \ page</a></li>\n<li>Launch the PuTTYgen application by double clicking the <code>puttygen.exe</code></li>\n\
    <li>The default settings are fine for this case, click the 'Generate' button</li>\n\
    <li>Save your public key by clicking 'Save public key' button. You should give\
    \ a\n name that will help identify the key in the future</li>\n<li>Save your private\
    \ key by clicking 'Save private key' button. You should give\n a sensible name\
    \ for future reference. The passphrase can provide additional\n security, though\
    \ can be left empty.</li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<h3>Linux/Mac User</h3>\n<p>On Mac and\
    \ Linux computers, commands are entered directly in the 'Terminal' application.</p>\n\
    <p><code>ssh-keygen -t rsa -f Nectar_Key</code></p>\n<ol>\n<li>To generate a keypair,\
    \ enter the previous command in the Terminal.</li>\n<li>Instead of \"Nectar_Key\"\
    , enter your preferred key name.</li>\n<li>By default, key files will be generated\
    \ in the directory '~/.ssh'. Check with <code>ls ~/.ssh</code></li>\n<li>You should\
    \ see a private key (e.g. 'Nectar_Key') and a public key (e.g. 'Nectar_Key.pub')</li>\n\
    </ol>\n<p>Note: For the security of your private key, ensuring only the user can\
    \ read the file:\nOn you local computer, enter <code>chmod 600 ~/.ssh/Nectar_Key</code>.</p>\n\

          \ The Nectar Cloud provides supported computing infrastructure, giving\n\
          researchers access to computing resources without the need to purchase or\
          \ host their own hardware. \nAll Australian researchers have access to the\
          \ Nectar Cloud via the AAF. \n To access the cloud all users must first\
          \ login through the\nNectar Cloud dashboard:\nhttps://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au/\
          \ \n Instances \n Instances running inside the Research Cloud are just like\
          \ real-life machines but\nin a remote location. The Research Cloud is used\
          \ to start, copy and delete\ninstances. They have an operating system (you\
          \ select it from a list), network\naccess (a real IP address & you specify\
          \ any access), and hard disk storage.\nWith no hardware to maintain you\
          \ can copy (Snapshot) and customise new\nmachines rapidly. \n Tools \n The\
          \ Nectar Cloud Dashboard \n The Dashboard provides a web interface to get\
          \ all the basic\nResearch Cloud related jobs done. \n Use the dashboard:\
          \ \n \n for basic Cloud operations: (launching, duplicating & terminating\
          \ ) instances; \n to get Credentials\n  you can use with other API clients;\
          \ \n to make an allocation request for a larger ongoing share of Research\
          \ Cloud Resources. \n \n More about instances \n If you are familiar with\
          \ connecting to remote machines already\nthe same tools and techniques apply\
          \ when connecting to running\ninstances. Your instance has a public IP address\
          \ and, if\nconfigured, can be reached and controlled with any remote\naccess\
          \ tools you wish to use. For example, SSH. \n More information about launching\
          \ and managing instances is here \n Images \n Instances originate from Images\
          \ and can be a plain \"off the\nshelf\" Operating System or include software\
          \ packages and\nconfig changes to suit a particular purpose (e.g.: serving\
          \ web pages).\nThere are publicly available images in the cloud ready for\n\
          you to use. \n To suit your specific purposes an instance may need some\n\
          customisation, configuration changes or software installation.\nIts a good\
          \ idea to make a copy of the instance if you wish to\nre-use its current\
          \ state as a starting point for new instances.\nIf you are experimenting\
          \ and making changes, a copy allows you\nto return to the copied state and\
          \ dispose of the experiment\nwithout having to undo/redo configuration changes.\
          \ \n You can create an Image from scratch, but usually its easier\nto customise\
          \ & copy a running instance that is close\nto what you need. \n Copies of\
          \ instances are called Snapshots and can be used\nlike other Images to start\
          \ new instances. Making a Snapshot\nis simple: \n \n Go to the Dashboard\
          \ \"Instances\" \n   tab; \n Click \"Create Snapshot\" for the running instance\
          \ you wish to copy. \n \n Key Pairs \n Key pairs enable you to communicate\
          \ with your instance via\nSSH. When launching an instance you specify an\
          \ existing key\npair. The public key is injected into the running\ninstance's\
          \ authorized_keys file. \n You can manage your key pairs through the Dashboard\
          \ or via\nthe nova CLI client. \n In the dashboard under the Access & Security\n\
          tab you can manage your keys. You have the option of: \n \n Importing an\
          \ existing SSH key you own; \n Creating a new SSH Key. \n \n Important:\
          \ Key pairs can only be specified on instance\ncreation, if you don't specify\
          \ a keypair on creation you will\nnot be able to add it later. \n Security\
          \ groups \n Incoming network access to your machines is usually required.\n\
          Security Groups are how to add network access. If you can't\nreach your\
          \ instance by SSH to login or by browser if it\nruns a web server additional\
          \ Security Group settings could be\nneeded. \n The OpenStack article title\
          \ \"Security Groups\"\ngives more information. \n Storage in the cloud \n\
          \ The NeCTAR Research Cloud provides instances for research\nuse. While\
          \ resources like processing cores, RAM and the\namount of storage you get\
          \ are dedicated to a particular\ninstance, other resources like the network\
          \ and the underlying\nstorage system are shared among instances. Furthermore,\
          \ not\nall storage is created equal, the Research Cloud offers: \n \n \n\
          Object storage; \n \nBlock storage; \n Transient/Ephemeral storage. \n \n\
          \ You can decide which suits your needs best by reading the OpenStack article\n\
          titled \"Storage Decisions\" "

    http://nectar.org.au/\">Nectar</a> (National eResearch Collaboration Tools and\
    \ Resources) is an\nAustralian Government project funded to build new infrastructure\
    \ specifically for the needs of\nAustralian researchers. The Nectar Cloud provides\
    \ supported computing infrastructure, giving\nresearchers access to computing\
    \ resources without the need to purchase or host their own hardware.<br>\nAll\
    \ Australian researchers have access to the Nectar Cloud via the <a href=\"http://support.rc.nectar.org.au/node/111\"\
    >AAF</a>.</p>\n<p>To access the cloud all users must first login through the\n\
    Nectar Cloud dashboard:\n<a href=\"https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au/\">https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au/</a></p>\n\
    <h2>Instances</h2>\n<p>Instances running inside the Research Cloud are just like\
    \ real-life machines but\nin a remote location. The Research Cloud is used to\
    \ start, copy and delete\ninstances. They have an operating system (you select\
    \ it from a list), network\naccess (a real IP address &amp; you specify any access),\
    \ and hard disk storage.\nWith no hardware to maintain you can copy (Snapshot)\
    \ and customise new\nmachines rapidly.</p>\n<h2>Tools</h2>\n<h3>The Nectar Cloud\
    \ Dashboard</h3>\n<p>The Dashboard provides a web interface to get all the basic\n\
    Research Cloud related jobs done.</p>\n<p>Use the dashboard:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>for\
    \ basic Cloud operations: (launching, duplicating &amp; terminating ) instances;</li>\n\
    <li>to get <a href=\"https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au/project/access_and_security/\"\
    >Credentials</a>\n  you can use with other <a href=\"http://docs.openstack.org/cli-reference/content/ch_cli.html\"\
    >API clients</a>;</li>\n<li>to make an allocation request for a larger ongoing\
    \ share of Research Cloud Resources.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>More about instances</h3>\n\
    <p>If you are familiar with connecting to remote machines already\nthe same tools\
    \ and techniques apply when connecting to running\ninstances. Your instance has\
    \ a public IP address and, if\nconfigured, can be reached and controlled with\
    \ any remote\naccess tools you wish to use. For example, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell\"\
    >SSH</a>.</p>\n<p>More information about launching and managing instances is <a\
    \ href=\"https://support.nectar.org.au/support/solutions/articles/6000073471-introduction-to-instance-management\"\
    >here</a></p>\n<h3>Images</h3>\n<p>Instances originate from Images and can be\
    \ a plain \"off the\nshelf\" Operating System or include software packages and\n\
    config changes to suit a particular purpose (e.g.: serving web pages).\nThere\
    \ are publicly available images in the cloud ready for\nyou to use.</p>\n<p>To\
    \ suit your specific purposes an instance may need some\ncustomisation, configuration\
    \ changes or software installation.\nIts a good idea to make a copy of the instance\
    \ if you wish to\nre-use its current state as a starting point for new instances.\n\
    If you are experimenting and making changes, a copy allows you\nto return to the\
    \ copied state and dispose of the experiment\nwithout having to undo/redo configuration\
    \ changes.</p>\n<p>You can create an Image from scratch, but usually its easier\n\
    to customise &amp; copy a running instance that is close\nto what you need.</p>\n\
    <p>Copies of instances are called Snapshots and can be used\nlike other Images\
    \ to start new instances. Making a Snapshot\nis simple:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to the\
    \ Dashboard \"<a href=\"https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au/project/instances/\"\
    >Instances</a>\" \n   tab;</li>\n<li>Click \"Create Snapshot\" for the running\
    \ instance you wish to copy.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Key Pairs</h2>\n<p>Key pairs enable\
    \ you to communicate with your instance via\nSSH. When launching an instance you\
    \ specify an existing key\npair. The public key is injected into the running\n\
    instance's authorized_keys file.</p>\n<p>You can manage your key pairs through\

    <h2>What should I do when I am finished with an instance</h2>

    <p>When you are finished with an Instance, you should terminate it.  Leaving an

    instance running, or in "paused" or "suspended" or "shutdown" states is tying

    down resources that other people could be using.</p>

    <p>Note that terminating an instance destroys its primary and ephemeral file

    systems.  If you want to save the primary file system (so that you can launch
    a

    new instance), snapshot the instance before you terminate it.</p>'

          \ them in order for it\nto function properly. Among these resources, storage\
          \ is the fundamental component\nfor both the virtual machine and user to\
          \ save and use data. The amount of\nstorage your virtual machine get are\
          \ dedicated, but the underlying storage\nsystem are shared. Furthermore,\
          \ not all storage is created equal, and Research\nCloud users have a few\
          \ different types of storage available which differ\naccording to performance,\
          \ persistence and data safety. \n On Virtual Machine Storage \n Each virtual\
          \ machine in the NeCTAR Cloud comes with a certain amount of built-in\n\
          storage and theseappear as two separated hard disks\n(Root Disk and Ephemeral\
          \ Disk). These storage disks run off robust\nenterprise-grade storage hardware\
          \ on the back. However, both storage disks are not\nsuitable for long-term\
          \ persistent data as data will be lost after termination or\nrebuild of\
          \ a virtual machine. \n Root Disk \n This storage is used for the operating\
          \ system of the virtual machine, to boot it\ninto a functional state. It\
          \ has a limited 10GB in size, which is the same for every\nstandard size\
          \ of virtual machine (Small, Medium, Large, Extra Large and\nExtra Extra\
          \ Large). The size varies for non-standard virtual machines such as\ntiny,\
          \ which only has 5GB root storage. \n Data stored on the root storage are\
          \ persistent until the termination or rebuild\nof the virtual machine and\
          \ are copied during the snapshot. That means, if you\nreboot your virtual\
          \ machine, the data remains intact and when you take a\npoint-in-time snapshot\
          \ of your virtual machine, the entire root storage is\ncopied. As the root\
          \ storage comes with fixed size and is used by the operation\nsystem, caution\
          \ need to be taken as it should not be filled in full. The name of\nthis\
          \ disk as seen from the virtual machine is usually '/dev/vda'. \n Ephemeral\
          \ Disk \n This storage appears as a second hard disk in your virtual machine.\
          \ It is a raw\nand unformatted block device, that you can format and use\
          \ as you wish. It varies\nin size according to the size of virtual machine\
          \ (from 0GB to 480GB). For each\nCPU, a standard virtual machine will get\
          \ 30GB of additional ephemeral storage.\nIt varies in size for non-standard\
          \ virtual machines. The name of this device as\nseen from the instance is\
          \ usually '/dev/vdb' and some operating systems will\nautomatically format\
          \ and mount the ephemeral disk. For example, Ubuntu creates\nan ext3 partition\
          \ and mounts it at '/mnt'. For operating systems that don't do it\nautomatically,\
          \ you can format it by executing mkfs.ext4 /dev/vdb in the command line\n\
          and mount it by executing mount /dev/vdb /mnt. You need to have root\npermission\
          \ to do this. \n Data stored on ephemeral disk are only persistent until\
          \ the termination or\nrebuild of the virtual machine (like the root disk).\
          \ The only difference\nis that data on the ephemeral disk are not copied\

          Your data on a persistent volume are retained even when you terminate your\n\
          virtual machine. Persistent Volumes offer a snapshot feature which can be\
          \ used\nto make convenient backups (this uses some of your overall Persistent\
          \ Volume quota). \n NOTE: Persistent Volumes are local services and only\
          \ virtual machines in the\navailability zone where the persistent Volume\

          \ \n By default, there are no persistent volume storage available to your\
          \ project.\nYou need to make an allocation request to apply for the quantity\
          \ of persistent volume\nstorage you require for your project. Follow these\
          \ steps to submit a\nrequest: \n \n \n Login to NeCTAR Cloud Dashboard \n\
          \ \n \n Go to Allocations and you can either click 'New Request' to make\
          \ a new request\n or 'My Requests' to amend an existing request \n \n \n\
          \ Under section 'Storage Quota', you select 'Resource' as volume, select\
          \ the\n Zone you want the storage to be located at (must be the same location\
          \ as the instance it will be attached to) and enter the size in GB under\
          \ 'Requested Quota'. \n \n \n Click the 'Submit' button \n \n \n NOTE: It\
          \ may take a while for your request to be approved. \n Create a persistent\
          \ volume storage \n Once your request has been approved, your project should\
          \ have volume storage\navailable. You need to create the volume storage\
          \ in the NeCTAR Cloud Dashboard \nbefore you can use it. \n \n \n Login\
          \ to the NeCTAR Cloud Dashboard \n \n \n Go to 'Volumes' \n \n \n Click\
          \ 'Create Volume' button \n \n \n Give a Volume Name and meaningful description\
          \ \n \n \n Specify a 'Volume Source' to determine how the volume will be\
          \ built. You can select\n 'No source empty volume' to create new empty volume.\
          \ You can select 'image' to\n build a volume from a image or 'Volume' to\
          \ build a volume from existing volume \n \n \n Specify the size of the volume\
          \ in GB \n \n \n Enter an 'Availability Zone' (must be the same zone as\
          \ the instance) \n \n \n Click 'Create Volume' button \n \n \n Attach a\
          \ persistent volume storage \n You can attach the volume created earlier\
          \ to a running virtual machine. See the\nbelow instruction: \n \n \n Login\

          \ Volume Storage in Virtual Machine \n For a standard flavor virtual machine\
          \ the persistent volume will be attached\nas '/dev/vdc'.  \n A new volume\
          \ may not have a file system (depending on how it was created) and\nyou\

          \ is dependent on the virtual machine' operating\nsystem and the type of\
          \ file system you require. \n You can use below command to create file system\
          \ on the new volume:\nsudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/vdc \n WARNING: This can cause\
          \ data loss if a file system already exists on the target\nVolume. \n You\
          \ can use below command to mount the volume (choose any volume-name). \n\
          \ sudo mkdir /volume_name \n sudo mount /dev/vdc /volume_name -t auto \n\
          \ NOTE: At first, you will not be able to save information to the ephemeral\
          \ disk. \nThe following command gives permission for the user 'ubuntu' to\
          \ write to the ephemeral disk: \n sudo chown ubuntu /mnt \n Notes:\nVolumes\
          \ must be detached before deletion. \n Check your Storage \n Here are some\
          \ commands that can allow you to look at your mounted storage blocks\nand\
          \ keep track of their usage: \n lsblk -l  for info : man lsblk \n df -hT\
          \  for info : man df \n du -h <path/to/directory>  for info : man du \n\
          \ Object Storage \n The NeCTAR Cloud Object Storage is not a traditional\
          \ file system, but rather a\ndistributed storage system for static data\
          \ such as virtual machine images,\nphoto storage, email storage, backups\
          \ and archives. Having no central \"brain\" or\nmaster point of control\
          \ provides greater scalability, redundancy and durability.\nWhen you put\
          \ a file in the NeCTAR Cloud Object Store, 3 copies of your data are\ndistributed\
          \ to different hardware for extra data safety and performance. \n Think\
          \ about that dataset comprised of 2GB files that you read in and analyse\n\
          many times, but in general it doesn't change. Or the images you want to\
          \ use on\nthe cloud. Those are a couple examples of perfect data for Object\
          \ Storage.\nObjects are written to multiple hardware devices in the data\
          \ center to ensure\nintegrity, and great performance! \n In general, the\
          \ object store is great for data you write once and read many\ntimes, but\
          \ not suitable for applications like databases. It's the safest place\n\
          to put your data on the NeCTAR Research Cloud as multiple redundant copies\
          \ of\nyour data are made, and it has great performance. You can access the\
          \ object\nstore from anywhere on the Internet, and data from Object Storage\
          \ can be\ntransferred to and from your virtual machine with a variety of\
          \ http-capable\ntools. \n Object Storage is completely decoupled from your\
          \ virtual machine, so even if you\nreboot, delete or crash your virtual\
          \ machine, your Object Storage files will\nremain safe (unless you remove\
          \ them yourself). Object Storage persists\nindependently of the life of\
          \ an instance. \n Swift \n Swift is the component that provides object storage\
          \ for OpenStack. With your\ncredentials and via a URL you can request Swift\
          \ to reserve & create storage\n(called containers or buckets). Files (known\
          \ as objects when stored in Swift)\ncan then be uploaded and accessed similarly\
          \ by your running virtual machines. \n The NeCTAR implementation of Swift\
          \ is geodistributed across Nodes of the NeCTAR\nCloud so that availability\
          \ does not rely on any one data center or network\ninfrastructure. Each\
          \ collection of Swift nodes/hardware is known as a region,\nwhich may or\
          \ may not include a Swift proxy server (the Internet facing and\nserving\
          \ component of Swift). With some Swift clients/APIs users can explicitly\n\
          chose which proxy to connect to, this might be useful e.g. for speeding\
          \ up\nwrites to object storage by choosing the nearest proxy. Due to NeCTAR's\
          \ Swift\nhaving multiple regions (some of which are Node private) some clients/APIs\n\
          require explicit configuration of a default region, which should be \"Melbourne\"\
          \nfor most users. "
        description: "<p>The NeCTAR virtual machines have many resources binded with\
          \ them in order for it\nto function properly. Among these resources, storage\
          \ is the fundamental component\nfor both the virtual machine and user to\
          \ save and use data. The amount of\nstorage your virtual machine get are\
          \ dedicated, but the underlying storage\nsystem are shared. Furthermore,\
          \ not all storage is created equal, and Research\nCloud users have a few\
          \ different types of storage available which differ\naccording to performance,\
          \ persistence and data safety.</p>\n<h2>On Virtual Machine Storage</h2>\n\
          <p>Each virtual machine in the NeCTAR Cloud comes with a certain amount\
          \ of built-in\nstorage and theseappear as two separated hard disks\n(Root\
          \ Disk and Ephemeral Disk). These storage disks run off robust\nenterprise-grade\
          \ storage hardware on the back. However, both storage disks are not\nsuitable\
          \ for long-term persistent data as data will be lost after termination or\n\
          rebuild of a virtual machine.</p>\n<h3>Root Disk</h3>\n<p>This storage is\
          \ used for the operating system of the virtual machine, to boot it\ninto\
          \ a functional state. It has a limited 10GB in size, which is the same for\
          \ every\nstandard size of virtual machine (Small, Medium, Large, Extra Large\
          \ and\nExtra Extra Large). The size varies for non-standard virtual machines\
          \ such as\ntiny, which only has 5GB root storage.</p>\n<p>Data stored on\
          \ the root storage are persistent until the termination or rebuild\nof the\
          \ virtual machine and are copied during the snapshot. That means, if you\n\
          reboot your virtual machine, the data remains intact and when you take a\n\
          point-in-time snapshot of your virtual machine, the entire root storage\
          \ is\ncopied. As the root storage comes with fixed size and is used by the\
          \ operation\nsystem, caution need to be taken as it should not be filled\
          \ in full. The name of\nthis disk as seen from the virtual machine is usually\
          \ '/dev/vda'.</p>\n<h3>Ephemeral Disk</h3>\n<p>This storage appears as a\
          \ second hard disk in your virtual machine. It is a raw\nand unformatted\
          \ block device, that you can format and use as you wish. It varies\nin size\
          \ according to the size of virtual machine (from 0GB to 480GB). For each\n\
          CPU, a standard virtual machine will get 30GB of additional ephemeral storage.\n\
          It varies in size for non-standard virtual machines. The name of this device\
          \ as\nseen from the instance is usually '/dev/vdb' and some operating systems\
          \ will\nautomatically format and mount the ephemeral disk. For example,\
          \ Ubuntu creates\nan ext3 partition and mounts it at '/mnt'. For operating\
          \ systems that don't do it\nautomatically, you can format it by executing\
          \ <code>mkfs.ext4 /dev/vdb</code> in the command line\nand mount it by executing\
          \ <code>mount /dev/vdb /mnt</code>. You need to have root\npermission to\
          \ do this.</p>\n<p>Data stored on ephemeral disk are only persistent until\
          \ the termination or\nrebuild of the virtual machine (like the root disk).\

  html: "<p>The NeCTAR virtual machines have many resources binded with them in order\
    \ for it\nto function properly. Among these resources, storage is the fundamental\
    \ component\nfor both the virtual machine and user to save and use data. The amount\
    \ of\nstorage your virtual machine get are dedicated, but the underlying storage\n\
    system are shared. Furthermore, not all storage is created equal, and Research\n\
    Cloud users have a few different types of storage available which differ\naccording\
    \ to performance, persistence and data safety.</p>\n<h2>On Virtual Machine Storage</h2>\n\
    <p>Each virtual machine in the NeCTAR Cloud comes with a certain amount of built-in\n\
    storage and theseappear as two separated hard disks\n(Root Disk and Ephemeral\
    \ Disk). These storage disks run off robust\nenterprise-grade storage hardware\
    \ on the back. However, both storage disks are not\nsuitable for long-term persistent\
    \ data as data will be lost after termination or\nrebuild of a virtual machine.</p>\n\
    <h3>Root Disk</h3>\n<p>This storage is used for the operating system of the virtual\
    \ machine, to boot it\ninto a functional state. It has a limited 10GB in size,\
    \ which is the same for every\nstandard size of virtual machine (Small, Medium,\
    \ Large, Extra Large and\nExtra Extra Large). The size varies for non-standard\
    \ virtual machines such as\ntiny, which only has 5GB root storage.</p>\n<p>Data\
    \ stored on the root storage are persistent until the termination or rebuild\n\
    of the virtual machine and are copied during the snapshot. That means, if you\n\
    reboot your virtual machine, the data remains intact and when you take a\npoint-in-time\
    \ snapshot of your virtual machine, the entire root storage is\ncopied. As the\
    \ root storage comes with fixed size and is used by the operation\nsystem, caution\
    \ need to be taken as it should not be filled in full. The name of\nthis disk\
    \ as seen from the virtual machine is usually '/dev/vda'.</p>\n<h3>Ephemeral Disk</h3>\n\
    <p>This storage appears as a second hard disk in your virtual machine. It is a\
    \ raw\nand unformatted block device, that you can format and use as you wish.\
    \ It varies\nin size according to the size of virtual machine (from 0GB to 480GB).\
    \ For each\nCPU, a standard virtual machine will get 30GB of additional ephemeral\
    \ storage.\nIt varies in size for non-standard virtual machines. The name of this\
    \ device as\nseen from the instance is usually '/dev/vdb' and some operating systems\
    \ will\nautomatically format and mount the ephemeral disk. For example, Ubuntu\
    \ creates\nan ext3 partition and mounts it at '/mnt'. For operating systems that\
    \ don't do it\nautomatically, you can format it by executing <code>mkfs.ext4 /dev/vdb</code>\
    \ in the command line\nand mount it by executing <code>mount /dev/vdb /mnt</code>.\
    \ You need to have root\npermission to do this.</p>\n<p>Data stored on ephemeral\
    \ disk are only persistent until the termination or\nrebuild of the virtual machine\
    \ (like the root disk). The only difference\nis that data on the ephemeral disk\
    \ are not copied when taking a snapshot of a virtual\nmachine, which means you\
    \ cannot use snapshot to save data stored on ephemeral\ndisk.</p>\n<p>NOTE: At\
    \ first, you will not be able to save information to the ephemeral disk. \nThe\
    \ following command gives permission for the user 'ubuntu' to write to the ephemeral\
    \ disk:</p>\n<p><code>sudo chown ubuntu /mnt</code></p>\n<h4>Backup of Ephemeral\
    \ Disk</h4>\n<p>Data on the ephemeral disk does not get saved in a snapshot, and\
    \ requires other\ntechniques to make a backup. Other forms of storage can be used\
    \ such as the\nObject Store and Volume Storage within the Research Cloud or external\
    \ locations.</p>\n<h2>Persistent Volume Storage</h2>\n<p>Persistent volume storage\
    \ can live outside your virtual machine. It appears\nas block storage which can\
    \ be attached then accessed and even booted from. This\nis a storage volume that\
    \ you can attach to from within your virtual machine,\nread and write data, detach\
    \ it, and make it available to another virtual machine.\nYour data on a persistent\
    \ volume are retained even when you terminate your\nvirtual machine. Persistent\
    \ Volumes offer a snapshot feature which can be used\nto make convenient backups\
    \ (this uses some of your overall Persistent Volume quota).</p>\n<p>NOTE: Persistent\
    \ Volumes are local services and only virtual machines in the\navailability zone\
    \ where the persistent Volume has been created can access it.</p>\n<h3>How to\
    \ Get Persistent Volume Storage</h3>\n<p>By default, there are no persistent volume\
    \ storage available to your project.\nYou need to make an allocation request to\
    \ apply for the quantity of persistent volume\nstorage you require for your project.\
    \ Follow these steps to submit a\nrequest:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Login to NeCTAR\
    \ Cloud <a href=\"https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au\">Dashboard</a></p>\n</li>\n\
    <li>\n<p>Go to Allocations and you can either click 'New Request' to make a new\
    \ request\n or 'My Requests' to amend an existing request</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Under\
    \ section 'Storage Quota', you select 'Resource' as volume, select the\n Zone\
    \ you want the storage to be located at (must be the same location as the instance\
    \ it will be attached to) and enter the size in GB under 'Requested Quota'.</p>\n\
    </li>\n<li>\n<p>Click the 'Submit' button</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>NOTE: It may take\
    \ a while for your request to be approved.</p>\n<h3>Create a persistent volume\
    \ storage</h3>\n<p>Once your request has been approved, your project should have\
    \ volume storage\navailable. You need to create the volume storage in the NeCTAR\
    \ Cloud Dashboard \nbefore you can use it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Login to the NeCTAR\
    \ Cloud <a href=\"https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au\">Dashboard</a></p>\n</li>\n\
    <li>\n<p>Go to 'Volumes'</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click 'Create Volume' button</p>\n\
    </li>\n<li>\n<p>Give a Volume Name and meaningful description</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\
    <p>Specify a 'Volume Source' to determine how the volume will be built. You can\
    \ select\n 'No source empty volume' to create new empty volume. You can select\
    \ 'image' to\n build a volume from a image or 'Volume' to build a volume from\
    \ existing volume</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Specify the size of the volume in GB</p>\n\
    </li>\n<li>\n<p>Enter an 'Availability Zone' (must be the same zone as the instance)</p>\n\
    </li>\n<li>\n<p>Click 'Create Volume' button</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Attach a persistent\
    \ volume storage</h3>\n<p>You can attach the volume created earlier to a running\
    \ virtual machine. See the\nbelow instruction:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Login to NeCTAR\
    \ Cloud <a href=\"https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au\">Dashboard</a></p>\n</li>\n\
    <li>\n<p>Go to 'Volumes'</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click the action list of volume</p>\n\
    </li>\n<li>\n<p>Click 'Edit Attachment'</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click 'Attach to\
    \ Instance' drop down list to select a virtual machine to\n attach the volume\
    \ to.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click 'Attach Volume' button</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Use\
    \ Persistent Volume Storage in Virtual Machine</h3>\n<p>For a standard flavor\
    \ virtual machine the persistent volume will be attached\nas '/dev/vdc'. </p>\n\
    <p>A new volume may not have a file system (depending on how it was created) and\n\
    you need to create one before mounting.</p>\n<p>The exact mount command syntax\
    \ is dependent on the virtual machine' operating\nsystem and the type of file\
    \ system you require.</p>\n<p>You can use below command to create file system\
    \ on the new volume:\n<code>sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/vdc</code></p>\n<p>WARNING: This\
    \ can cause data loss if a file system already exists on the target\nVolume.</p>\n\
    <p>You can use below command to mount the volume (choose any volume-name).</p>\n\
    <p><code>sudo mkdir /volume_name</code></p>\n<p><code>sudo mount /dev/vdc /volume_name\
    \ -t auto</code></p>\n<p>NOTE: At first, you will not be able to save information\
    \ to the ephemeral disk. \nThe following command gives permission for the user\
    \ 'ubuntu' to write to the ephemeral disk:</p>\n<p><code>sudo chown ubuntu /mnt</code></p>\n\
    <p>Notes:\nVolumes must be detached before deletion.</p>\n<h2>Check your Storage</h2>\n\
    <p>Here are some commands that can allow you to look at your mounted storage blocks\n\
    and keep track of their usage:</p>\n<p><code>lsblk -l</code>  for info : <code>man\
    \ lsblk</code></p>\n<p><code>df -hT</code>  for info : <code>man df</code></p>\n\
    <p><code>du -h &lt;path/to/directory&gt;</code>  for info : <code>man du</code></p>\n\
    <h2>Object Storage</h2>\n<p>The NeCTAR Cloud Object Storage is not a traditional\
    \ file system, but rather a\ndistributed storage system for static data such as\
    \ virtual machine images,\nphoto storage, email storage, backups and archives.\
    \ Having no central \"brain\" or\nmaster point of control provides greater scalability,\
    \ redundancy and durability.\nWhen you put a file in the NeCTAR Cloud Object Store,\
    \ 3 copies of your data are\ndistributed to different hardware for extra data\
    \ safety and performance.</p>\n<p>Think about that dataset comprised of 2GB files\
    \ that you read in and analyse\nmany times, but in general it doesn't change.\
    \ Or the images you want to use on\nthe cloud. Those are a couple examples of\
    \ perfect data for Object Storage.\nObjects are written to multiple hardware devices\
    \ in the data center to ensure\nintegrity, and great performance!</p>\n<p>In general,\
    \ the object store is great for data you write once and read many\ntimes, but\
    \ not suitable for applications like databases. It's the safest place\nto put\
    \ your data on the NeCTAR Research Cloud as multiple redundant copies of\nyour\
    \ data are made, and it has great performance. You can access the object\nstore\
    \ from anywhere on the Internet, and data from Object Storage can be\ntransferred\
    \ to and from your virtual machine with a variety of http-capable\ntools.</p>\n\
    <p>Object Storage is completely decoupled from your virtual machine, so even if\
    \ you\nreboot, delete or crash your virtual machine, your Object Storage files\
    \ will\nremain safe (unless you remove them yourself). Object Storage persists\n\
    independently of the life of an instance.</p>\n<h3>Swift</h3>\n<p>Swift is the\
    \ component that provides object storage for OpenStack. With your\ncredentials\
    \ and via a URL you can request Swift to reserve &amp; create storage\n(called\
    \ containers or buckets). Files (known as objects when stored in Swift)\ncan then\
    \ be uploaded and accessed similarly by your running virtual machines.</p>\n<p>The\
    \ NeCTAR implementation of Swift is geodistributed across Nodes of the NeCTAR\n\
    Cloud so that availability does not rely on any one data center or network\ninfrastructure.\
    \ Each collection of Swift nodes/hardware is known as a region,\nwhich may or\
    \ may not include a Swift proxy server (the Internet facing and\nserving component\
    \ of Swift). With some Swift clients/APIs users can explicitly\nchose which proxy\
    \ to connect to, this might be useful e.g. for speeding up\nwrites to object storage\
    \ by choosing the nearest proxy. Due to NeCTAR's Swift\nhaving multiple regions\
    \ (some of which are Node private) some clients/APIs\nrequire explicit configuration\
    \ of a default region, which should be \"Melbourne\"\nfor most users.</p>"

          \ The default Security Group is empty and no incoming access is configured\
          \ until\nyou add rules to specify: \n \n which ports are available for connection\
          \ to your instance and... \n from which addresses your instance will accept\
          \ inbound traffic to the\n  open ports \n \n \n NOTE: If you do not specify\
          \ a security group at boot, the default security\ngroup will be applied\
          \ \n \n \n Each rule adds further access; it never cancels or overrides\
          \ another rule. \n Rules can have overlapping ranges and addresses. \n Rules\
          \ for the same ports and addresses can be added to more than one\n  Security\
          \ Group \n \n Removing Network Access \n To remove access to a port or from\
          \ an address, locate all security groups with\nrules relating to that port\
          \ or address, then \n \n remove or edit each applicable rule, OR \n do not\
          \ apply those Security Groups that contain the applicable rule(s) \n \n\
          \ Pre-Defined and Default Security Groups \n For Project Trials (pt-xxxx)\
          \ there are pre-defined security groups for\nconvenience. \n \n SSH opens\
          \ tcp port 22 to traffic from all sources (for logging via ssh) \n HTTP\
          \ opens tcp ports 80 and 443 to traffic from all sources (for\n  web servers)\
          \ \n ICMP opens all ICMP traffic from all sources (etc. to allow pinging\
          \ your\n  VMs IP address) \n \n For all other shared projects that are created\
          \ after an allocation request,\nthere is only the empty 'default' security\
          \ group at first. These Projects\nshare their security groups so all changes\
          \ should be made with caution as\nthey may affect instances by other users\
          \ sharing your Project. \n Managing Security Groups \n Sometimes it can\
          \ be convenient to organise rules into multiple Security\nGroups,\nfor example\
          \ \n \n apply only some or all groups depending on a instances purpose.\
          \ \n users experimenting with network access can remove groups and re-apply\n\
          \  them without re-creating rules each time \n testing rules on a temporary\
          \ security group and test Instance before\n  adding the same rules to Security\
          \ Groups already in use.\n  Rules can appear in more than one Security Group\
          \ \n \n Applying Security Groups \n Security Groups are most conveniently\
          \ applied before Launching your\ninstance. Multiple security groups can\
          \ be selected.\nSecurity Groups can also be added or removed on running\
          \ instances. \n Click 'Launch' then click the 'Security Groups' field. The\
          \ default group is\npre-selected. \n Outgoing traffic \n Outgoing traffic\
          \ is not blocked on any port:  connections that originate\nfrom your instance\
          \ to the outside world are not blocked by Nectar\nOpenStack configuration\
          \ \n \n Security Note \n Using the Research Cloud creates a publicly accessible\
          \ server (depending on\nSecurity Groups) and therefore that machine can\
          \ be exploited. All users must\nread & follow our Security Guidelines. \n\

          \ terms can be found at: http://docs.openstack.org/glossary/content/glossary.html\
          \ \n The terms \n A \n AAF  - The Australian Access Federation. A\nShibboleth-based\
          \ federated authentication service for the Australian academic community.\n\
          Also the name of the organization that runs the AAF service. \n AARNET -\
          \ Australia's Academic & Research Network - the organization that runs the\n\
          networks connecting Australia's Universities and Research Organizations.\
          \ \n Access Control  - The process of determining if an (authenticated)\
          \ agent is\npermitted to perform some action.  Synonym: Authorization. \n\
          \ Access Group - OpenStack terminology that is a synonym for Security Group.\
          \ \n Access Rule  - An access rule allow network access to an\ninstance\
          \ from other hosts with a specified combination of protocol family (e.g.\
          \ TCP, UDP, UCMP),\nport number and address range. \n Account - OpenStack\
          \ terminology. A synonym for \"project\" and \"tenant\". \n Active Directory\
          \ (AD) - Microsoft's directory service product; essentially LDAP enhanced\
          \ with\nKerberos. Most Microsoft Windows environments will use AD to centrally\
          \ control\nauthentication. \n AMD - Advanced Micro Devices Inc. A manufacturer\
          \ of x86 and x86_64 compatible\nmicroprocessors. A direct competitor to\
          \ Intel. \n API - Application Programming Interface - an interface that\
          \ that is designed for\nprograms to use (As distinct from a user interface,\
          \ which is designed for\npeople to use). \n API Endpoint  - See Service\
          \ endpoint. \n apt  - The package manager used by the Debian\nfamily (Debian/Ubuntu/Mint)\
          \ of Linux distributions. \n Aspera - \"Aspera High-speed File Transfer\
          \ Software that moves the world's data at maximum\nspeed, regardless of\
          \ file size, transfer distance or network conditions\". \n Attach - An OpenStack\
          \ volume can be attached to an OpenStack instance to provide it with\nadditional\
          \ disk storage. \n Authentication - The process of establishing that an\
          \ agent (i.e. a person, or other entity) in a\ncomputer system is who they\
          \ say they are.  The simple username and password\nis the most familiar\
          \ means of authentication. \n Authorization - See Access Control. \n Availability\
          \ Zone (AZ) - a logical grouping of compute nodes within a region. \n AWS\
          \ - Amazon Web Services. \n Azure - Microsoft's commercial cloud computing\

          \ Virtual Laboratory. \n Boot - The boot (or \"bootstrap\") process is the\
          \ means by which the computer starts\nitself up after the power button is\
          \ pressed.  Ultimately booting is the process\nin which a computer goes\
          \ from having empty memory to having the operating\nsystem loaded and running.\
          \ \n Bricked - Colloquialism: describes a system that has been damaged in\
          \ a way that\npermanently locks out some or all functionality.  It's usually\
          \ the consequence\nof some kind of firmware update that fails to run properly,\
          \ or at all, meaning\nfurther remedial firmware updates are not possible.\
          \  The device is bricked when\nit can't be fixed and is effectively an expensive\
          \ square shaped \"brick\". \n C \n Canonical - Canonical Ltd. is a UK-based\
          \ privately held computer software company founded\n(and funded) by South\
          \ African entrepreneur Mark Shuttleworth to market\ncommercial support and\

          \ Collection Development Storage. \n Ceilometer - The OpenStack Ceilometer\
          \ project aims to deliver a unique point of\ncontact for billing systems\
          \ to acquire all of the measurements they need to\nestablish customer billing,\
          \ across all current OpenStack core components. \n It is also a means by\
          \ which to gather performance related metrics useful for the\ngeneral management\
          \ of the OpenStack environment in general. \n Cell - Cells are a means by\
          \ which to partition an OpenStack compute cloud into groups. \n At NeCTAR\
          \ each site runs a different configuration, as a resource cells in an\n\
          OpenStack Compute cells setup. This allows the NeCTAR nodes to do different\n\
          things such as span multiple data centers, or run off compute node storage\n\
          with a shared file system, or use on compute node storage with a non-shared\
          \ file\nsystem.  It's also a way to partition tenants and accounts. \n CentOS\
          \ - A community-based rebadging of RHEL distribution.  The result is \"\
          for free\", but with\n no support. \n Ceph - \"Ceph is a unified, distributed\
          \ storage system designed for excellent\nperformance, reliability and scalability.\"\
          \  Volume and object storage\nare typically implemented using Ceph. \n CephFS\
          \ - A project aimed and making Ceph work akin to a traditional filesystem\n\
          ala ext4 or xfs.  It is still considered experimental at this stage. \n\
          \ Chef - A recipe based system configuration framework. A main competitor\
          \ to Puppet, but\nalso now to other such systems such as Ansible and Salt.\
          \ \n CIDR Notation - Classless Internet Domain Routing notation - a concise\
          \ notation for writing IPv4\n or IPv6 network address ranges. \n Cinder\
          \ - The OpenStack Volume Storage management service. \n The \"Cloud\" -\
          \ A network of servers used to store, manage, and process data to achieve\n\
          efficiencies of scale in completing various computational tasks. \n CloudStor\
          \ - A free cloud-based file transfer service provided by AARNET. Allows\
          \ researchers\n to send and receive large files (up to 100Gb) or the big\
          \ brother CloudStor+\nwhich is an enhanced version of CloudStor that supports\
          \ secure long-term file\nstorage. \n Cluster-as-a-service - Implementing\
          \ HPC-style compute facilities on top of cloud computing\ninfrastructure.\
          \ \n Collection - RDSI Collection - Large data collection, usually formalised\
          \ with metadata and\nmade discoverable and accessible. Stored as part of\
          \ a data storage investment\nproject called RDSI (Research Data Storage\
          \ Infrastructure). Operators of the\ninfrastructure from RDSI project are\
          \ called RDSI nodes and may still refer to\ntheir storage facilities or\
          \ collections as 'RDSI storage' or 'RDSI collection'. \n Collection VM -\
          \ RDSI collections in QRIScloud are exposed via virtual machines that run\
          \ access\nservices; e.g. scp, sftp, rsync, WebDAV & GridFTP. \n Compute\
          \ Node   - OpenStack terminology for a physical computer\nused to run virtual\
          \ machines. It will typically have multiple CPUs and shared memory, and\n\
          one or more network interfaces.  It may also have on-node disc storage.\
          \ \n Container - General Computing - a means by which to run multiple \"\
          things\" inside a given\ncomputer and have those things isolated from each\
          \ other and the computer itself.\nSimilar in concept to Virtualisation,\
          \ however not as broadly applicable because\nthe containers must be the\
          \ same operating system as the host itself. \n Copyleft - A form of software\
          \ licensing that uses Copyright Law as the legal basis for\ngranting and\
          \ enforcing license terms. \n Creative Commons - A family of licenses originally\
          \ designed for creative (non-software) works,\nthat is often used for published\
          \ scientific data. \n CVL - Characterization Virtual Laboratory - A NeCTAR\
          \ Virtual Laboratory project. \n D \n DaRIS (Distributed and Reflective\
          \ Informatics System) - DaRIS\nis a subject-oriented informatics framework\
          \ and capability developed\nprimarily at the University of Melbourne. It\
          \ is built with the commercial\nMediaflux data operating system. DaRIS is\
          \ mainly used to supply a repository to\nmanage bio-medical imaging data.\
          \ \n Dashboard - The NeCTAR Dashboard is the main web-based interface for\
          \ managing NeCTAR\nvirtuals. The OpenStack component service for the dashboard\
          \ is called Horizon. \n Data Centre - A place where a large collection of\
          \ shared computing equipment is housed.\nThese expensive and high security\
          \ installations are often hot and noisy and\nconsume hard drives for breakfast.\
          \ \n Data Repository - A system or service that provides systematic data\
          \ management services. More\nthan just \"a shared fileserver\". \n .deb\
          \ - The Debian standard package format. See apt. \n Debian Family - Debian,\
          \ Ubuntu, Mint and many lesser known but similar linux distributions. \n\
          \ Distribution (Linux) - Refers to a (ideally) homoginized release of the\
          \ Linux Kernel and a\ncompendium of utilities, services and applications\
          \ that are nominally modified\nand tested to run well together, then given\
          \ an odd name like \"Mandriva\" or\n\"Suse\" or \"Debian\".  May inherit\
          \ concepts, frameworks and software\nfrom other distributions with or without\
          \ attribution or other reciprocal\ncontribution.  Typically distributions\
          \ attract a zealous user base\nwho will willingly fight each other to the\
          \ bitter death over not much at all.\nSome are funded by corporations, others\
          \ by well meaning techno hippies or not\nby anyone at all. \n Distro - A\
          \ contraction of \"Distribution\". \n DMF - DMF is a\nHierarchical Storage\
          \ Management (HSM) system by SGI designed for\nthe bulk storage of data.\
          \ The basic premise is that fast storage is expensive so\nwouldn't it be\
          \ cool if we could put only the data we actually use on the fast\nstorage,\
          \ and the rest can kind of trickle through less expensive storage layers.\n\
          So the hierarchy is in fact a sandwich of storage technologies (usually\
          \ ssd,\nhdd, tape) at each of which the storage cost per gigabyte decreases.\
          \  As data\nages through the layers the usual trade off is speed, so ideally\
          \ frequently used\ndata stays on the faster storage layer.  Conversely,\
          \ data which is seldom\naccessed is often archived off to tape where the\
          \ cost per gigabyte is very low.\nMagical filesystems ideally make all of\
          \ this invisible to users and\napplications.  Usually highly expensive and\
          \ complicated, it's pretty awesome\nwhen it works. \n Docker - A tool that\
          \ helps automate the deployment of applications\ninside software containers.\
          \ \n DropBox - A company that offers cloud storage that is easily used for\
          \ file sharing\nand collaboration. \n Drupal - A popular open source website\
          \ / content management system. \n DSpace - An open source application used\
          \ to create open access repositories\nfor digital content. \n DuraSpace\
          \ - The not-for-profit organization that manages the DSpace and Fedora Repository\n\
          projects. \n E \n EC2 - Amazon's \"Elastic Compute\" offering. \n EC2 Credentials\
          \ - One of the kinds of credentials you can obtain from the NeCTAR Dashboard.\n\
          It allows software written to work with the Amazon cloud to be used with\
          \ the OpenStack cloud. \n Elastic Computing  - Cloud computing resources\
          \ that can be\nadded to or removed from. \n Ephemeral Storage - Disk storage\
          \ associated with a NeCTAR instance that goes away when the\ninstance is\
          \ terminated. \n ERSA - eResearch SA runs the South Australian node of the\
          \ NeCTAR research cloud. \n eSpace - The UQ library managed system for UQ\
          \ research publications. \n eSpaces - A web-based collaboration system for\
          \ the Australian academic community. \n F \n FAQ - A Frequently Asked Question.\
          \ A software project or an IT support organization\nwill often create an\
          \ online FAQ document consisting of a number of such\nquestions, and their\
          \ answers. \n Fedora - RedHat's \"bleeding edge\" Linux distro (It was called\
          \ Fedora Core in early\nreleases). \n Fedora Repository -  The Flexible\
          \ Extensible Digital Object Repository Architecture\nwas developed for storing,\
          \ managing, and accessing digital content in the form of digital\nobjects.\
          \ The Fedora Repository Project (i.e., Fedora) implements the Fedora abstractions\n\
          in a open source software system. \n Fez - A front-end and administration\
          \ tool for the Fedora Repository. \n Flashlight - An RCC / QCIF HPC system\
          \ designed for data intensive computation. \n Flavor - An OpenStack term\
          \ for an instance sizing specification. Gives the amount of\nmemory, number\
          \ of VCPUs and ephemeral disc size. \n G \n Galaxy - A web based platform\
          \ for biomedical research. \n Ganglia - A distributed monitoring system.\
          \ \n Git - A popular distributed version control system. \n Github - A popular\

          \ - <a href=\"https://www.sgi.com/products/storage/idm/dmf.html\">DMF</a>\
          \ is a\nHierarchical Storage Management (HSM) system by SGI designed for\n\
          the bulk storage of data. The basic premise is that fast storage is expensive\
          \ so\nwouldn't it be cool if we could put only the data we actually use\
          \ on the fast\nstorage, and the rest can kind of trickle through less expensive\
          \ storage layers.\nSo the hierarchy is in fact a sandwich of storage technologies\
          \ (usually ssd,\nhdd, tape) at each of which the storage cost per gigabyte\
          \ decreases.  As data\nages through the layers the usual trade off is speed,\
          \ so ideally frequently used\ndata stays on the faster storage layer.  Conversely,\
          \ data which is seldom\naccessed is often archived off to tape where the\
          \ cost per gigabyte is very low.\nMagical filesystems ideally make all of\
          \ this invisible to users and\napplications.  Usually highly expensive and\
          \ complicated, it's pretty awesome\nwhen it works.</p>\n<p><strong>Docker</strong>\

    \ then given an odd name like \"Mandriva\" or\n\"Suse\" or \"Debian\".  May inherit\
    \ concepts, frameworks and software\nfrom other distributions with or without\

    >DMF</a> is a\nHierarchical Storage Management (HSM) system by SGI designed for\n\
    the bulk storage of data. The basic premise is that fast storage is expensive\
    \ so\nwouldn't it be cool if we could put only the data we actually use on the\
    \ fast\nstorage, and the rest can kind of trickle through less expensive storage\
    \ layers.\nSo the hierarchy is in fact a sandwich of storage technologies (usually\
    \ ssd,\nhdd, tape) at each of which the storage cost per gigabyte decreases. \
    \ As data\nages through the layers the usual trade off is speed, so ideally frequently\
    \ used\ndata stays on the faster storage layer.  Conversely, data which is seldom\n\
    accessed is often archived off to tape where the cost per gigabyte is very low.\n\
    Magical filesystems ideally make all of this invisible to users and\napplications.\
    \  Usually highly expensive and complicated, it's pretty awesome\nwhen it works.</p>\n\

  html: '<h2>Installation</h2>

    <p>You can use pip to install the python-swift API and the swfit command line
    API.</p>

    <p>See below for the instructions:</p>

    <p>OS X</p>

    <p>```</p>

    <p>sudo easy_install pip</p>

    <p>sudo pip install --upgrade setuptools</p>

    <p>sudo pip install python-swiftclient</p>

    <p>```</p>

    <p>Ubuntu</p>

    <p>```</p>

    <p>sudo aptitude install python-pip</p>

    <p>sudo pip install python-swiftclient</p>

    <p>```</p>

    <p>RHEL, CentOS, or Fedora</p>

    <p>```</p>

    <p>sudo yum install python-setuptools</p>

    <p>sudo easy_install pip</p>

    <p>sudo pip install --upgrade setuptools</p>

    <p>sudo pip install python-swiftclient</p>

    <p>```</p>

    <p>Windows</p>

    <p>See <a href="http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/win.html#distribute-pip">pip
    windows</a> for instructions on installing pip for Windows.</p>

    <p><code>pip install python-swiftclient</code></p>

    <h2>Configuration</h2>

    <p>Before you can use the python swift client and command line API you need to
    be

    authenticated to the NeCTAR cloud. The below shows the instructions of how to

    get username/password and get authenticated.</p>

    <ol>

    <li>Login to NeCTAR Cloud <a href="https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au">Dashboard</a></li>

    <li>Click ''Access &amp; Security''</li>

    <li>On the ''Access &amp; Security'' page, click tab ''API Access''</li>

    <li>Click button "Download OpenStack RC File"</li>

    <li>Save the file into a directory</li>

    <li>Click the drop down list with your email on the right top of page, then click
    ''Settings''</li>

    <li>Click ''Reset Password'' and save the password appeared on the screen</li>

    </ol>

    <p>API normally requires 4 environment variables to be set for authentication:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>auth URL</li>

    <li>username</li>

    <li>project id or name (most clients can handle either)</li>

    <li>password</li>

    </ul>

    <p>When using the script file you downloaded from NeCTAR Dashboard, these

    varilabels are set by the script file and you can see these variables

    if you open the file. Example:</p>

    <blockquote>

    <p>OS_AUTH_URL: https://keystone.rc.nectar.org.au:5000/v2.0/</p>

    <p>OS_TENANT_NAME=my_science_project</p>

    <p>OS_TENANT_ID=sdfsdfsfwrwewer</p>

    <p>OS_USERNAME=clouduser@example.edu.au</p>

    <p>OS_PASSWORD=XXXXXX</p>

    </blockquote>

    <h2>Authentication for Command Line API</h2>

    <p>The following instruction assume you use Linux operating system.</p>

    <p>Once you have obtained the authentication script and password, you can execute

    the script suing <code>source file-name.sh</code>. and type in the password you

    obtained from Dashboard.</p>

    <h3>Authentication for python swift API</h3>

    <p>You can use the below sample code to get authenticated. </p>

    <p>```</p>

    <p>from swiftclient import client</p>

    <p>swift = client.Connection(authurl=url, user=username, key=password,

    tenant_name=project_name, auth_version=''2'')</p>

    <p>```</p>

    <p>You can get authurl, user, key and tenant_name from the above .sh file obtained

    from the NeCTAR Dashboard.</p>

    <h2>How to use</h2>

    <p>Once the client is authenticated, you can start to use them. See below for
    how

    to get started.</p>

    <h3>Command Line API</h3>

    <p>You can use swift command to manage your objects storage, you can type:</p>

    <p><code>swift --help</code> to find out all the available options.</p>

    <h3>Python Swift API</h3>

    <p>You can also use Python Swift API in your python code to access object storage.</p>

    <p>See below for a sample code:</p>

    <p>```</p>

    <p>from swiftclient import client</p>

    <p>swift = client.Connection(authurl=url, user=username, key=password,

    tenant_name=project_name, auth_version=''2'')</p>

    <p>container_name=""</p>

    <p>swift.get_container(container_name)</p>

    <p>```</p>

    <p>You can find more information in the Object Storage API section. </p>'

    such as the ones at <a href="http://yamllint.com/">YAML Lint</a> or the <a href="http://yaml-online-parser.appspot.com/">Online
    Yaml Parser</a>

    can be useful in finding the syntax error.</p>

    <p>To convert from JSON to YAML, an online converter such as the one at

    <a href="http://jsontoyaml.com/">Convert JSON to YAML Online</a>

    can be useful in porting between the two formats.</p>

    <p>To debug JSON syntax errors the following command set is useful:</p>

    <p><code>cat template.json | python -m json.tool</code></p>

    <p>Where <code>template.json</code> is the name of your template. The command
    simply pipes the

    file into python, which in turn will invoke the json module that finally will

    validate and pretty print the file.</p>

    <p>Similarly, if you have the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyaml/">pyaml</a>
    module installed

    you can validate yaml files:</p>

    <p><code>cat template.yaml | python -m pyaml</code></p>

    <p>Where <code>template.yaml</code> is the name of your template.</p>

    <p>The form of the command in both of the above is useful, in that you can

    verify remote files:</p>

    <p><code>curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NeCTAR-RC/heat-templates/master/json/Fedora/WordPress_2_Instances.json
    | python -m json.tool</code></p>

    <p>If the stack launches, and reports no error, suspicion falls on

    the automated installation of software.</p>

    <p>In this scenario turn to on instances log files and scripts.</p>

    <p>On the newly launched image:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>Heat writes the scripts to the <code>/var/lib/cloud/</code> directory;</li>

    <li>The cloud init log can be found in <code>/var/log/cloud-init.log</code>;</li>

    <li>The output of your code run by cloud init can be found in <code>/var/log/cloud-init-output.log</code>;</li>

    <li>The output of the cfn init output is found in <code>/var/log/cfn-init.log</code>;</li>

    <li>The log showing the parts produced by heat can be found in <code>/var/log/part-handler.log</code>;</li>

    <li>The log showing the output of users scripts run can be found in <code>/var/log/heat-provisioning.log</code>.</li>

    </ul>

    <p>If the stack state does reveal an error start by trying to understand the

    command line client error messages.</p>

    <p>If you have nested templates, you can find the ones that failed to launch with

    the following command:</p>

    <p><code>heat stack-list --show-nested -f "status=FAILED"</code></p>

    <p>For a given template, you can see the list of events associated with the

    template:</p>

    <p><code>heat event-list &lt;template id&gt;</code></p>

    <p>You can then drill down into the events for a given resource:</p>

    <p><code>heat event-list -r &lt;resource name&gt; &lt;template id&gt;</code></p>

    <p>And then examine a specific event for more detail:</p>

    <p><code>heat event-show &lt;template id&gt; &lt;resource name&gt; &lt;event id&gt;</code></p>'

          \ of the fundamentals of Operating\nSystem on your Virtual Machines to implement\
          \ a good security policy. \n What is security?  Security is a set of appropriate\
          \ procedures to protect your\nresources (your data, your account, your services\
          \ and your reputation) against\nrisks. \n The NeCTAR cloud is a public Cloud\
          \ environment. Thus your virtual machines are\nconnected to the rest of\
          \ the world and there are many potential risks associated\nwith that. You\
          \ should always consider your Virtual Machines are vulnerable and\nsome\
          \ security policy and procedures must be implemented. \n Security is a big\
          \ topic and there many complete books on the subject. This\nguide provides\
          \ some basic introduction to security and how the techniques, and\ntools\
          \ can be used to provide additional security on a Virtual Machine. \n Security\
          \ requirements \n Before you implement security policy, you should consider\
          \ the aspects of\nsecurity that are required. The main security requirements\
          \ are:  \n \n \n Confidentiality (don't let anybody else know your password\
          \ confidential data) \n \n \n Authorization (Only allow these that need\
          \ to access data) \n \n \n Integrity (Ensure that the data has not been\
          \ modified) \n \n \n Availability (Ensure that system can perform its required\
          \ functions) \n \n \n Type of Attackers \n It is important to know the type\
          \ of attackers to the Virtual Machine. The types\nof attackers are listed\
          \ below: \n \n \n Crackers, there are people that gain unauthorized access\
          \ to a computer \n \n \n Hackers, any individual who illegally breaks into\
          \ computer systems to damage, \n steal information or perform some malicious\
          \ functions using the systems. \n \n \n Types of attacks against virtual\
          \ machines \n There are many different types of attacks and are different\
          \ depending upon the\noperating system, the service and type of attackers.\
          \ The below list only\nprovides some common types of attack and aims to\
          \ provide an idea of what areas to\nfocus on. \n \n \n Reading data: typically\
          \ associated with steal important information such as\n confidential data,\
          \ account information, passwords, etc. \n \n \n Changing data: potentially\
          \ to gain sufficient access to be able to update data \n \n \n Access to\
          \ virtual machine: get access to your virtual machine and use it to\n attach\
          \ other computer systems. The attackers might setup a service to send email\n\
          \ spam using your virtual machines \n \n \n Denial of service: attacker\
          \ disables or makes unusable the services provided\n by the system  \n \n\
          \ \n Common Methods of Attacking A Virtual machine \n The below shows some\
          \ techniques used to gain access and it only provides an idea\nof methods\
          \ used and doesn't include all available methods. \n \n \n Password guessing:\
          \ where attacks try to guess your system account password and\n in the hope\
          \ they will be lucky and find an easily guessed password. \n \n \n Social\
          \ engineering: attackers pretend to be someone you trust and gain\n information\
          \ (e.g. password) from you. \n \n \n Trojan horses: these are programs planted\
          \ in a virtual machine which appear to be\n harmless. When a trigger is\
          \ activated, the attacker can gain access to the \n virtual machine and\
          \ run certain commands. There are various ways these programs\n get onto\
          \ your virtual machines, such as by installing untrusted software\n packages.\
          \ \n \n \n virus: a virus is a program designed to damage the system. \n\
          \ \n \n software bugs: a software bug can lead to a security exposure. \n\
          \ \n \n address spoofing: this is to change the IP address of the computer,\
          \ to pretend \n it is a trusted system and gain access.  \n \n \n Security\
          \ Policy \n If you already have a security policy in place, you need to\
          \ follow these steps\nto secure your virtual machines. If you don't have\
          \ one, there are a number of\nfactors you need to consider when you are\
          \ creating a security policy. \n You need to make sure you have covered\
          \ each of the issues: Authorization, Authentication,\nConfidentiality, Integrity\
          \ and Availability. You also need to consider how the\npolicy is going to\
          \ be implemented as people might make mistakes. You should\nalways consider\
          \ how this can be enforced and audited.  "

    \ at all stages of setting up your\nVirtual Machines. It requires good knowledge\
    \ of the fundamentals of Operating\nSystem on your Virtual Machines to implement\
    \ a good security policy.</p>\n<p>What is security?  Security is a set of appropriate\
    \ procedures to protect your\nresources (your data, your account, your services\
    \ and your reputation) against\nrisks.</p>\n<p>The NeCTAR cloud is a public Cloud\
    \ environment. Thus your virtual machines are\nconnected to the rest of the world\
    \ and there are many potential risks associated\nwith that. You should always\
    \ consider your Virtual Machines are vulnerable and\nsome security policy and\
    \ procedures must be implemented.</p>\n<p>Security is a big topic and there many\
    \ complete books on the subject. This\nguide provides some basic introduction\
    \ to security and how the techniques, and\ntools can be used to provide additional\
    \ security on a Virtual Machine.</p>\n<h2>Security requirements</h2>\n<p>Before\
    \ you implement security policy, you should consider the aspects of\nsecurity\
    \ that are required. The main security requirements are: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Confidentiality\
    \ (don't let anybody else know your password confidential data)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\
    <p>Authorization (Only allow these that need to access data)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\
    <p>Integrity (Ensure that the data has not been modified)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Availability\
    \ (Ensure that system can perform its required functions)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\
    <h2>Type of Attackers</h2>\n<p>It is important to know the type of attackers to\
    \ the Virtual Machine. The types\nof attackers are listed below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n\
    <p>Crackers, there are people that gain unauthorized access to a computer</p>\n\

          \ impossible to address everything. This\ndocument lists a number of security\
          \ recommendations to help ensure the safe\nrunning of your instances on\
          \ the cloud. Security is important, so please\nfollow these. \n The NecTAR\
          \ team conduct routine and random audits to determine the integrity\nof\
          \ machine images and running instances. If you have discovered a critical\n\
          security flaw, or believe your machine has been compromised, please email\n\
          security@rc.nectar.org.au; or for non-urgent security questions go to NeCTAR\n\
          support to lodge a ticket. \n Mail Servers \n If you run a mail server,\
          \ make sure it only listens on the localhost IP\naddress (127.0.0.1). For\
          \ many clients, if you don't specify an SMTP server\nwhen sending email,\
          \ it will use the recipients SMTP server automatically. This\nis probably\
          \ what you want. Some nodes (Qld) disallow this and require you to\nuse\
          \ their SMTP server for outgoing mail. \n Enable Automatic Updates \n All\
          \ operating systems have the ability to apply updates automatically, and\
          \ its\neasy to turn this on. Please do so, and ask us if you need help.\
          \ \n Upgrade your kernel \n Some updates, such as a kernel upgrade, require\
          \ a reboot of the instance. Please\nschedule this into your regular maintenance.\
          \ \n No open recursive name servers \n If you are running a DNS server,\
          \ please ensure you only allow recursion from\ntrusted hosts. \n Control\
          \ or disable access to your NTP server \n If you run an NTP server, limit\
          \ which systems can access it. Disable the\n'monlist' command as this can\
          \ be used as a denial of service vector on your\nsystem. For info about\
          \ DDoS by NTP, see\nthis article on Cloudflare \n Subscribe to security\
          \ announcements for your OS \n If there is a security problem with your\
          \ Operating System, you need to find\nout as soon as possible. Find the\
          \ appropriate mailing list and keep an eye\nout for anything that requires\
          \ urgent action. As soon as new security bugs are\ndetected, you need to\
          \ execute security upgrade immediately.  \n Run a restrictive firewall \n\
          \ Your instances should be configured so they allow the minimum access required\n\
          to run their service. Please use a host-based firewall, in conjunction with\n\
          the cloud-provided firewall to manage access. \n Disable/Remove unneeded\
          \ accounts \n Keep an eye on the user accounts enabled on your system. Some\
          \ applications\ncreate default accounts which are insecure. You may also\
          \ open a temporary user\naccount to allow quick login for a task and leave\
          \ it forever. This may lead to\nsecurity issue later, and you need to regular\
          \ check and delete these user\naccounts. \n Disable SSH password login -\
          \ use keys \n With enough time and compute power it is possible for passwords\
          \ to be brute\nforce attacked. The average SSH server deals with thousands\
          \ of such attacks\nevery week, so use ssh keys. Ubuntu provides some good\
          \ documentation for it. \n Don't store keys on the image \n The cloud provides\
          \ a metadata service so you can download keys on boot, so\nyou don't need\
          \ to copy keys manually. This ensures that if your key is\ncompromised,\
          \ not all running instances of that image are compromised. \n Install SSH\
          \ attack banning tools \n Install a tools like fail2ban or denyhosts, which\
          \ checks log files for\nattempted breaches and then blocks malicious IP\
          \ addresses. \n Disable unneeded services \n Know what services run on your\
          \ image, and disable the unneeded ones before\nyou upload it. This reduces\
          \ the attack surface. \n Use Encrypted Communications \n Wherever possible,\
          \ use encrypted communications to avoid attacks which\nintercept data. \n\
          \ Use best-practices for logging \n Make sure that services are logging\
          \ to a secure location, that is as\ntamperproof as possible. If logging\
          \ remotely, ensure that it is done over\na secure channel so that eavesdroppers\
          \ cannot monitor what is happening on\nyour instance. \n Only open ports\
          \ for required services \n By default, virtual machines in NeCTAR has closed\
          \ all ports, so in order to make\nservices available to public, you need\
          \ to open certain ports for it. Before you\nopen a open, you need to think\
          \ carefully about what service associated with it\nand what is the intention.\
          \ Never open ports for non-service binded to it. \n Only grant sufficient\
          \ permission to user account \n When creating user account, make sure only\
          \ permission sufficient for its use \nis granted. Never grant extra permission\
          \ if it is not needed. \n Disable root access from SSH and use sudo if possible\
          \ \n Disable root user SSH login and setup user account with sudo permission\
          \ to\nperform administrator tasks. \n Use other port for SSH \n The SSH\
          \ service on the virtual machine uses port 22 by default. This port is \n\
          well-known and can attract many attackers. Use a custom ssh port other than\
          \ 22\nwill improve security. Be noted, the port number below 1024 is well\
          \ reserved and\nshouldn't be used for SSH. \n Read security guide for service\
          \ installed \n Before and after you install a new service on your virtual\
          \ machine, you need to\ncheck the service security guide to perform any\
          \ required steps to harden the\nservice security. "

  html: "<h2>Getting Started</h2>\n<p>Security is an complex topic and it is impossible\
    \ to address everything. This\ndocument lists a number of security recommendations\
    \ to help ensure the safe\nrunning of your instances on the cloud. Security is\
    \ important, so please\nfollow these.</p>\n<p>The NecTAR team conduct routine\
    \ and random audits to determine the integrity\nof machine images and running\
    \ instances. If you have discovered a critical\nsecurity flaw, or believe your\
    \ machine has been compromised, please email\n<a href=\"&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#115;&#101;&#99;&#117;&#114;&#105;&#116;&#121;&#64;&#114;&#99;&#46;&#110;&#101;&#99;&#116;&#97;&#114;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#103;&#46;&#97;&#117;\"\
    >&#115;&#101;&#99;&#117;&#114;&#105;&#116;&#121;&#64;&#114;&#99;&#46;&#110;&#101;&#99;&#116;&#97;&#114;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#103;&#46;&#97;&#117;</a>;\
    \ or for non-urgent security questions go to NeCTAR\n<a href=\"https://support.nectar.org.au/support/home\"\
    >support</a> to lodge a ticket.</p>\n<h2>Mail Servers</h2>\n<p>If you run a mail\
    \ server, make sure it only listens on the localhost IP\naddress (127.0.0.1).\
    \ For many clients, if you don't specify an SMTP server\nwhen sending email, it\
    \ will use the recipients SMTP server automatically. This\nis probably what you\
    \ want. Some nodes (Qld) disallow this and require you to\nuse their SMTP server\
    \ for outgoing mail.</p>\n<h2>Enable Automatic Updates</h2>\n<p>All operating\
    \ systems have the ability to apply updates automatically, and its\neasy to turn\
    \ this on. Please do so, and ask us if you need help.</p>\n<h2>Upgrade your kernel</h2>\n\
    <p>Some updates, such as a kernel upgrade, require a reboot of the instance. Please\n\
    schedule this into your regular maintenance.</p>\n<h2>No open recursive name servers</h2>\n\
    <p>If you are running a DNS server, please ensure you only allow recursion from\n\
    trusted hosts.</p>\n<h2>Control or disable access to your NTP server</h2>\n<p>If\
    \ you run an NTP server, limit which systems can access it. Disable the\n'monlist'\
    \ command as this can be used as a denial of service vector on your\nsystem. For\
    \ info about DDoS by NTP, see\n<a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/understanding-and-mitigating-ntp-based-ddos-attacks/\"\
    \ title=\"Cloudflare Understanding NTP DDoS\">this article on Cloudflare</a></p>\n\
    <h2>Subscribe to security announcements for your OS</h2>\n<p>If there is a security\
    \ problem with your Operating System, you need to find\nout as soon as possible.\
    \ Find the appropriate mailing list and keep an eye\nout for anything that requires\
    \ urgent action. As soon as new security bugs are\ndetected, you need to execute\
    \ security upgrade immediately. </p>\n<h2>Run a restrictive firewall</h2>\n<p>Your\
    \ instances should be configured so they allow the minimum access required\nto\
    \ run their service. Please use a host-based firewall, in conjunction with\nthe\
    \ cloud-provided firewall to manage access.</p>\n<h2>Disable/Remove unneeded accounts</h2>\n\
    <p>Keep an eye on the user accounts enabled on your system. Some applications\n\
    create default accounts which are insecure. You may also open a temporary user\n\
    account to allow quick login for a task and leave it forever. This may lead to\n\
    security issue later, and you need to regular check and delete these user\naccounts.</p>\n\
    <h2>Disable SSH password login - use keys</h2>\n<p>With enough time and compute\
    \ power it is possible for passwords to be brute\nforce attacked. The average\
    \ SSH server deals with thousands of such attacks\nevery week, so use ssh keys.\
    \ Ubuntu provides some good documentation for it.</p>\n<h2>Don't store keys on\
    \ the image</h2>\n<p>The cloud provides a metadata service so you can download\
    \ keys on boot, so\nyou don't need to copy keys manually. This ensures that if\
    \ your key is\ncompromised, not all running instances of that image are compromised.</p>\n\
    <h2>Install SSH attack banning tools</h2>\n<p>Install a tools like fail2ban or\
    \ denyhosts, which checks log files for\nattempted breaches and then blocks malicious\
    \ IP addresses.</p>\n<h2>Disable unneeded services</h2>\n<p>Know what services\
    \ run on your image, and disable the unneeded ones before\nyou upload it. This\
    \ reduces the attack surface.</p>\n<h2>Use Encrypted Communications</h2>\n<p>Wherever\
    \ possible, use encrypted communications to avoid attacks which\nintercept data.</p>\n\
    <h2>Use best-practices for logging</h2>\n<p>Make sure that services are logging\
    \ to a secure location, that is as\ntamperproof as possible. If logging remotely,\
    \ ensure that it is done over\na secure channel so that eavesdroppers cannot monitor\
    \ what is happening on\nyour instance.</p>\n<h2>Only open ports for required services</h2>\n\
    <p>By default, virtual machines in NeCTAR has closed all ports, so in order to\
    \ make\nservices available to public, you need to open certain ports for it. Before\
    \ you\nopen a open, you need to think carefully about what service associated\
    \ with it\nand what is the intention. Never open ports for non-service binded\
    \ to it.</p>\n<h2>Only grant sufficient permission to user account</h2>\n<p>When\
    \ creating user account, make sure only permission sufficient for its use \nis\
    \ granted. Never grant extra permission if it is not needed.</p>\n<h2>Disable\
    \ root access from SSH and use sudo if possible</h2>\n<p>Disable root user SSH\
    \ login and setup user account with sudo permission to\nperform administrator\
    \ tasks.</p>\n<h2>Use other port for SSH</h2>\n<p>The SSH service on the virtual\
    \ machine uses port 22 by default. This port is \nwell-known and can attract many\
    \ attackers. Use a custom ssh port other than 22\nwill improve security. Be noted,\
    \ the port number below 1024 is well reserved and\nshouldn't be used for SSH.</p>\n\
    <h2>Read security guide for service installed</h2>\n<p>Before and after you install\
    \ a new service on your virtual machine, you need to\ncheck the service security\
    \ guide to perform any required steps to harden the\nservice security.</p>"

  html: '<h1>The Heat command line client</h1>

    <p>In true OpenStack fashion there is a <a href="http://docs.openstack.org/user-guide/cli.html">Heat
    command line client</a>.

    To our biased eye, the command line tool seems more fully featured and

    gives more detailed feedback than the dashboard, so we prefer to use it

    when developing templates.</p>

    <p>Instructions on installing the command line tools can be found

    <a href="http://docs.openstack.org/user-guide/common/cli_install_openstack_command_line_clients.html">here</a>.</p>

    <p>We will step through some the actions the command line tool can perform,

    using one of the NeCTAR Heat sample templates.</p>

    <p>To list all the stacks you have created do (don''t forget to source your

    RC file before you start!):</p>

    <p><code>heat stack-list</code></p>

    <p>Repeat the above command liberally as you step through the following commands!</p>

    <p>To validate the template (all one line):</p>

    <p><code>heat template-validate --template-url https://raw.github.com/NeCTAR-RC/heat-templates/master/yaml/Fedora/WordPress_Single_Instance.yaml</code></p>

    <p>Then to use the template to create a stack named "teststack" (again, all one
    line):</p>

    <p><code>heat create teststack --template-url=https://raw.github.com/NeCTAR-RC/heat-templates/master/yaml/Fedora/WordPress_Single_Instance.yaml
    --parameters="InstanceType=m1.small;DBUsername=dbuser;DBPassword=verybadpassword;DBRootPassword=anotherverybadpassword;KeyName=nectar_dev"</code></p>

    <p><em>PS</em>: Don''t forget to customise the command: e.g.: replace the passwords
    with far

    better ones, and also to change the key name to match one of your keys.</p>

          \ You can manage instances for users via\nNeCTAR Dashboard. You can perform\
          \ many tasks such as view,\nterminate, reboot and create a snapshot from\
          \ an instance, etc.  \n Control the state of an instance \n To manage and\
          \ change the state of an instance, you can login to the NeCTAR\nDashboard\
          \ and follow the below steps: \n \n \n Login to Dashboard \n \n \n Authenticate\
          \ yourself via AAF \n \n \n Click 'Instances' on the left side of the page\
          \ and click 'Action' drop down\n list for an instance. You should see something\
          \ similar as the below screenshot \n \n \n \n The drop down list includes\
          \ all the available actions you can use to manage the\ninstance. The below\
          \ gives a brief explanation about them: \n \n \n Create Snapshot: create\
          \ a snapshot of instance. The snapshot will save all the\n state of instance\
          \ at the time you taking the snapshot and it can be used an\n image to launch\
          \ a new instance with all the saved state. Only primary disk is\n saved.\
          \ \n \n \n Edit Instance: change the name of the instance. \n \n \n Edit\
          \ Security Groups: you can add/delete security groups associated with the\n\
          \ instance. This allows your open/close ports after instance has been launched.\
          \ \n \n \n Console: this action allows you to access the instance via the\
          \ VNC console and\n allow your to access the instance via the web browser.\
          \ \n \n \n View Log: this action allows you view the boot messages that\
          \ normally displayed\n on the standard output (monitor). This is useful\
          \ for debugging. \n \n \n Pause Instance: this action temporarily pauses\
          \ the state of a running instance,\n it is useful for taking a snapshot.\
          \ \n \n \n Suspend Instance: this action stops a running instance. The difference\
          \ between\n pause and suspend is that pause is only for a shot period, all\
          \ resources binded\n to an instance are still available and suspend is for\
          \ long-term and resources may\n be removed. \n \n \n Soft Reboot Instance:\
          \ this action allows users to reboot the running instance. \n \n \n Hard\
          \ Reboot Instance: this action allows users to reboot the running instance.\n\
          \ The difference between soft reboot and hard reboot are that soft reboot\
          \ issues\n reboot signal to the running instance and will do a smooth reboot\
          \ and the hard\n reboot simulates the reboot like pressing the computer\
          \ power button. It is useful\n if the running instance is not responding\
          \ to any commands. \n \n \n Rebuild Instance: use different image to build\
          \ a new instance. The new instance\n maintains the same specification of\
          \ the old instance such as cpus, rams and etc.\n Remember, this action will\
          \ destroy all data in the instance and need to use with\n caution. \n \n\
          \ \n Terminate Instance: permanently delete the instance and data is removed\
          \ as well. \n \n \n You can refer to this document to see more information\
          \ about\nmanaging instances. \n Create instance snapshots \n To create an\
          \ snapshot, you can click 'Create Snapshot' from the above action list\n\
          and you will see a pop-up window like below: \n \n Provide a meaningful\
          \ name and the click 'Create Snapshot' button. \n Notes: You should always\
          \ pause the instance before snapshot it. However, live\nsnapshot is also\
          \ possible and you need to make sure the snapshot is consistent\nwith the\
          \ instance as the snapshot doesn't capture the state of the memory. So\n\
          before snapshot, you need to ensure that: \n \n \n running programs have\
          \ written their contenst to disk \n \n \n the file system does not have\
          \ any 'dirty' buffers \n \n \n For Linux user, you can execute sync to write\
          \ dirty buffer to disk.\nIt is not sufficient to only use sync to get file\
          \ system consistent. It is\nrecommend to use fsfreeze tool. In ubuntu, you\
          \ can run sudo apt-get install util-linux\nto install the fsfreeze tool.\
          \ \n To freeze a file system, you can run fsfreeze -f /mnt as a root user\n\
          in a command line console, where /mnt is the file system mount point. \n\
          \ After you created the snapshot, you can unfreeze the file system by executing\
          \ fsfreeze -u /mnt\nwhere /mnt is the file system mount point. \n You can\
          \ refer to Taking Snapshot for more information. \n Change security group\
          \ \n You can click \"Edit Security groups\" from the drop down list to add/remove\n\
          security group for a running instance. \n \n From the above screenshot,\
          \ You can see the currently applied security groups are\nlisted on the right\
          \ hand side and left hand side is a list of available security\ngroups.\
          \ You can click the plus button to add the available security groups\nto\
          \ the right hand side and click the minus button to remove a security group.\n\
          Once you have done, you can click 'Save' button to save your changes.  \n\
          \ Launch a VNC console \n Sometimes, you need to access your instance directly\
          \ via a web browser and you\ncan do it by using the VNC console. The console\
          \ provides a great way to access\nthe instance if you haven't open port\
          \ for SSH. \n Click the \"console\" item from the drop down list and you\
          \ should see a screen\nlike below: \n \n You can then click the 'Click here\
          \ to show only console' and you should see the\nfollowing screen: \n \n\
          \ After the login prompt appears, you can type in username and password\
          \ to login\nto the instance and perform any task as required. \n View log\
          \ \n The console log provides very useful information that may be required\
          \ in\ntroubleshooting issues. You can access the log by clicking \"view\
          \ log\" item from\nthe action drop down list. After clicking, you should\
          \ see the following screen: \n \n This gives you the latest system log messages,\
          \ if you want to see the full logs,\nyou can click the 'View Full Log Button'.\
          \ \n Create and Manage Volumes \n You can attach volumes as persistent storage\
          \ to instances. You can attach or\ndetach a volume from a instance at any\
          \ time and it is also easy to create snapshot\nfrom or delete a volume.\
          \ \n To create a volume, you can follow the below steps: \n \n \n Log in\
          \ to the dashboard \n \n \n select the project from the CURRENT PROJECT\
          \ on the Project tab \n \n \n On the Project tab, open the Compute tab and\
          \ click Volumes category \n \n \n Click 'Create Volume' button \n \n \n\
          \ In the pop-up window, you can enter or select the following values: \n\
          \ \n \n Volume Name: name for the volume \n Description: description for\
          \ the volume \n Type: Leave this field blank \n Size: The size of the volume\
          \ in gigabytes \n Volume Source: To create a standard empty disk for data\
          \ storage, select \"No source, empty volume\" \n Availability Zone: Select\
          \ the Availability Zone from the list \n \n \n Click 'Create Volume' button\
          \ \n \n \n The dashboard shows the volume on the 'Volumes' tab. \n \n \n\
          \ To attach a volume to an instance:  \n \n \n Log in to the dashboard[dashboard\
          \ ] \n \n \n select the project from the CURRENT PROJECT on the Project\
          \ tab \n \n \n On the Project tab, open the Compute tab and click Volumes\
          \ category \n \n \n Select the volume to add to an instance and in the action\
          \ drop down list, \n click Edit Attachments \n \n \n In the Manage Volume\
          \ Attachments dialog box, select an instance and click\n 'Attach Volume'\
          \ button \n \n \n To detach a volume from an instance: \n \n \n Log in to\
          \ the dashboard, choose a project, and click Volumes \n \n \n Select the\
          \ volume and click Edit Attachments \n \n \n Click 'Detach Volume' button\
          \ and confirm your changes \n \n \n To delete a volume: \n \n \n Log in\
          \ to the dashboard, choose a project, and click Volumes \n \n \n Select\
          \ the check boxes for the volumes that you want to delete. \n \n \n Click\
          \ 'Delete Volumes' button and confirm your choice. \n \n \n Note: the data\
          \ in its attached volumes is not destroyed after you delete a volume "

          \ instance snapshots</h2>\n<p>To create an snapshot, you can click 'Create\
          \ Snapshot' from the above action list\nand you will see a pop-up window\
          \ like below:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"snapshot\" src=\"https://github.com/NeCTAR-RC/nectarcloud-tier0doco/blob/master/articles/Cloud%20Expert--DOCID19/Instance%20Management--DOCID39/images/snapshot.png?raw=true\"\
          ></p>\n<p>Provide a meaningful name and the click 'Create Snapshot' button.</p>\n\
          <p>Notes: You should always pause the instance before snapshot it. However,\
          \ live\nsnapshot is also possible and you need to make sure the snapshot\
          \ is consistent\nwith the instance as the snapshot doesn't capture the state\
          \ of the memory. So\nbefore snapshot, you need to ensure that:</p>\n<ul>\n\
          <li>\n<p>running programs have written their contenst to disk</p>\n</li>\n\
          <li>\n<p>the file system does not have any 'dirty' buffers</p>\n</li>\n\
          </ul>\n<p>For Linux user, you can execute <code>sync</code> to write dirty\
          \ buffer to disk.\nIt is not sufficient to only use sync to get file system\
          \ consistent. It is\nrecommend to use fsfreeze tool. In ubuntu, you can\
          \ run <code>sudo apt-get install util-linux</code>\nto install the fsfreeze\
          \ tool.</p>\n<p>To freeze a file system, you can run <code>fsfreeze -f /mnt</code>\
          \ as a root user\nin a command line console, where /mnt is the file system\
          \ mount point.</p>\n<p>After you created the snapshot, you can unfreeze\
          \ the file system by executing <code>fsfreeze -u /mnt</code>\nwhere /mnt\
          \ is the file system mount point.</p>\n<p>You can refer to <a href=\"http://docs.openstack.org/openstack-ops/content/snapshots.html\"\

  html: "<h1>Manage instances</h1>\n<p>As an NeCTAR Cloud administrative user, You\
    \ can manage instances for users via\nNeCTAR <a href=\"https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au/\"\
    >Dashboard</a>. You can perform many tasks such as view,\nterminate, reboot and\
    \ create a snapshot from an instance, etc. </p>\n<h2>Control the state of an instance</h2>\n\
    <p>To manage and change the state of an instance, you can login to the NeCTAR\n\
    <a href=\"https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au/\">Dashboard</a> and follow the below\
    \ steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Login to <a href=\"https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au/\"\
    >Dashboard</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Authenticate yourself via AAF</p>\n</li>\n\
    <li>\n<p>Click 'Instances' on the left side of the page and click 'Action' drop\
    \ down\n list for an instance. You should see something similar as the below screenshot</p>\n\
    </li>\n</ul>\n<p><img alt=\"instance management\" src=\"https://github.com/NeCTAR-RC/nectarcloud-tier0doco/blob/master/articles/Cloud\
    \ Expert--DOCID19/Instance Management--DOCID39/images/instance_management.png?raw=true\"\
    ></p>\n<p>The drop down list includes all the available actions you can use to\
    \ manage the\ninstance. The below gives a brief explanation about them:</p>\n\
    <ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Create Snapshot:</strong> create a snapshot of instance.\
    \ The snapshot will save all the\n state of instance at the time you taking the\
    \ snapshot and it can be used an\n image to launch a new instance with all the\
    \ saved state. Only primary disk is\n saved.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Edit\
    \ Instance:</strong> change the name of the instance.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Edit\
    \ Security Groups:</strong> you can add/delete security groups associated with\
    \ the\n instance. This allows your open/close ports after instance has been launched.</p>\n\
    </li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Console:</strong> this action allows you to access the\
    \ instance via the VNC console and\n allow your to access the instance via the\
    \ web browser.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>View Log:</strong> this action allows\
    \ you view the boot messages that normally displayed\n on the standard output\
    \ (monitor). This is useful for debugging.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Pause\
    \ Instance:</strong> this action temporarily pauses the state of a running instance,\n\
    \ it is useful for taking a snapshot.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Suspend Instance:</strong>\
    \ this action stops a running instance. The difference between\n pause and suspend\
    \ is that pause is only for a shot period, all resources binded\n to an instance\
    \ are still available and suspend is for long-term and resources may\n be removed.</p>\n\
    </li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Soft Reboot Instance:</strong> this action allows users\
    \ to reboot the running instance.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Hard Reboot Instance:</strong>\
    \ this action allows users to reboot the running instance.\n The difference between\
    \ soft reboot and hard reboot are that soft reboot issues\n reboot signal to the\
    \ running instance and will do a smooth reboot and the hard\n reboot simulates\
    \ the reboot like pressing the computer power button. It is useful\n if the running\
    \ instance is not responding to any commands.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Rebuild\
    \ Instance:</strong> use different image to build a new instance. The new instance\n\
    \ maintains the same specification of the old instance such as cpus, rams and\
    \ etc.\n Remember, this action will destroy all data in the instance and need\
    \ to use with\n caution.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Terminate Instance:</strong>\
    \ permanently delete the instance and data is removed as well.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\

          \ to manage your instances in projects and NeCTAR\ncloud provides instance\
          \ management via API. There are two types of API you can use\nto manage\
          \ your instance, one is Nova command line API and another is Nova python\n\
          API. Which one to use depends on your needs. The Nova python API is great\
          \ if you\nwant integrate it with python programming to manage instance in\
          \ a programmatic way.\nIf you are a system administrator and you probably\
          \ will prefer to use Nova command\nline API through a console to manage\
          \ instances. Both of them provides more\nmanagement options than you can\
          \ do through the Dashboard.  \n Installation \n You can use pip to install\
          \ the python-nova API and the nova command line API. \n See below for the\

          \ \n Configuration \n Before you can use the python nova client and command\
          \ line API you need to be\nauthenticated to the NeCTAR cloud. The below\
          \ shows the instructions of how to\nget username/password and get authenticated.\
          \ \n \n \n Login to NeCTAR Cloud Dashboard \n \n \n Click the drop down\
          \ list beside the top left nectar logo to select a project \n \n \n Click\
          \ 'Access & Security' \n \n \n On the 'Access & Security' page, click tab\
          \ 'API Access' \n \n \n Click button \"Download OpenStack RC File\" \n \n\
          \ \n Save the file into a directory \n \n \n Click the drop down list with\

          \ 'Reset Password' and save the password appeared on the screen \n \n \n\
          \ Nova API normally requires 4 environment variables to be set for authentication:\
          \ \n \n auth URL \n username \n project id or name (most clients can handle\
          \ either) \n password \n \n When using the script file you downloaded from\
          \ NeCTAR Dashboard, these\nvariables are set by the script file and you\
          \ can see these variables\nif you open the file. Example: \n \n OS_AUTH_URL:\
          \ https://keystone.rc.nectar.org.au:5000/v2.0/ \nOS_TENANT_NAME=my_science_project\
          \ \nOS_TENANT_ID=sdfsdfsfwrwewer \nOS_USERNAME=clouduser@example.edu.au\
          \ \nOS_PASSWORD=XXXXXX \n \n Authentication for Command Line API \n The\
          \ below instruction assumes you use Linux operating system. \n Once you\
          \ have obtained the authentication script and password, you can execute\n\
          the script using source file-name.sh. and type in the password you\nobtained\
          \ from Dashboard. \n Authentication for python swift API \n You can use\
          \ the below sample code to get authenticated.  \n from novaclient import\
          \ client \n nova = client.Client(VERSION, USERNAME, PASSWORD, PROJECT_NAME,\
          \ AUTH_URL) \n The VERSION parameter can be \"1.1\" or \"2\". You can get\
          \ USERNAME, PROJECT_NAME and\nAUTH_URL from the above .sh file obtained\
          \ from the NeCTAR Dashboard and you can\nalso get the PASSWORD from above\
          \ as copied from the NeCTAR Dashboard. \n Nova Command Line API \n To get\
          \ information about about managing instances in a selected project: \n\n\

          \ is a security policy applied and\nyour account might not have sufficient\
          \ permission.  \n Managing an Instance \n To boot a new instance, you need\
          \ to get image name, keypair name, security group\nname and flavor name.\
          \ You can use the above mentioned commands to acquire these\ninformation.\
          \ Then, you can use nova boot command to launch a new instance, the\nformat\
          \ is: \n nova boot [instance-name]  --flavor [name] --image [name] --key-name\
          \ [name] --security-groups [names separated by space] \n You can also specify\
          \ option --availability-zone to launch an instance in a\ndesigned zone and\
          \ option --user-data  for a initialization script\nused only for the first\
          \ time when instance boots. The user data script can be\nput in a file and\
          \ then passed to instance creation. You can see check this\nwebsite to see\
          \ what script you can use to initialize an instance.  \n\n\n\nCommands for\

    \ and type in the password you\nobtained from Dashboard.</p>\n<h3>Authentication\
    \ for python swift API</h3>\n<p>You can use the below sample code to get authenticated.\
    \ </p>\n<p><code>from novaclient import client</code></p>\n<p><code>nova = client.Client(VERSION,\
    \ USERNAME, PASSWORD, PROJECT_NAME, AUTH_URL)</code></p>\n<p>The VERSION parameter\
    \ can be \"1.1\" or \"2\". You can get USERNAME, PROJECT_NAME and\nAUTH_URL from\
    \ the above .sh file obtained from the NeCTAR Dashboard and you can\nalso get\
    \ the PASSWORD from above as copied from the NeCTAR Dashboard.</p>\n<h2>Nova Command\

    designed zone and option --user-data <user-data-file> for a initialization script\n\
    used only for the first time when instance boots. The user data script can be\n\
    put in a file and then passed to instance creation. You can see check this\n<a\

          \ takes more effects as it depends on how familiar\nwith Python programming\
          \ and what development environment you use. \n The below provides some basic\
          \ information about how you debug the Nova Python\nAPI. \n You can debug\
          \ your python code using Python debugger called pdb and you can find\nmore\
          \ information here. \n The below code uses pdb debuuger to debug a python\
          \ file contains clinet python\nAPI code. \n pdb file_name.py \n Once you\
          \ executed the above code, the command line will be stopped on the first\n\
          line of code and you can use some commands to control the execution flow.\
          \ \n Some useful ones to use are: \n\n\n\nCommand\nAction\n\n\n\n\nb\nset\
          \ a breakpoint\n\n\nc\ncontinue debugging until you hit a breakpoint\n\n\

          \nd\nnavigate down a stack frame\n\n\np\nto print the value of an expression\
          \ in the current context\n\n\n\n Debugging Via HTTP \n The both of command\
          \ line API and python API are restful web service client.\nThus the requests\
          \ are all made by using HTTP and you can always refer to\nOpenStack Service\
          \ End for further references about what should be\npresented in the HTTP\
          \ requests. The Nova API uses requests library\nto send and receive HTTP\
          \ requests/responses. \n For command line client, you can add --debug option\
          \ to print out HTTP request\nheader and HTTP response header, which give\
          \ you a lot of more insight\ninformation. To verify parameters in the request\
          \ header, you can refer to\nOpenStack service API to see what are expected.\
          \ \n To enable debugging information on the standard out for Python API,\
          \ you can add\nthe below code: \n ``` \n import logging \n logger = logging.getLogger(\"\
          novaclient\") \n logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG) \n ``` \n The\
          \ will print the same output as adding --debug option for command line API.\
          \ \n Debugging via Source Code \n If the above techniques are still not\
          \ helpful, you can always look at the source\ncode to find the problems.\
          \ \n The below source file structure is based on the installation in Ubuntu.\
          \ \n The command line nova command is located in '/usr/bin/nova'. By looking\

    <h2>Debugging Via HTTP</h2>

    <p>The both of command line API and python API are restful web service client.

    Thus the requests are all made by using HTTP and you can always refer to

    <a href="http://developer.openstack.org/api-ref-objectstorage-v1.html">OpenStack
    Service End</a> for further references about what should be

    presented in the HTTP requests. The Nova API uses <a href="http://www.python-requests.org/en/latest/">requests</a>
    library

    to send and receive HTTP requests/responses.</p>

    <p>For command line client, you can add --debug option to print out HTTP request

    header and HTTP response header, which give you a lot of more insight

    information. To verify parameters in the request header, you can refer to

    OpenStack service <a href="http://developer.openstack.org/api-ref-objectstorage-v1.html">API</a>
    to see what are expected.</p>

    <p>To enable debugging information on the standard out for Python API, you can
    add

    the below code:</p>

    <p>```</p>

    <p>import logging</p>

    <p>logger = logging.getLogger("novaclient")</p>

    <p>logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)</p>

    <p>```</p>

    <p>The will print the same output as adding --debug option for command line API.</p>

    <h2>Debugging via Source Code</h2>

    <p>If the above techniques are still not helpful, you can always look at the source

    code to find the problems.</p>

    <p>The below source file structure is based on the installation in Ubuntu.</p>

    <p>The command line nova command is located in ''/usr/bin/nova''. By looking at
    this

    file, you should get a idea of how the various options are interpreted. This file

    acts as an interface for Python API.</p>

    <p>The Python API files are located under

    ''/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/novaclient'' and the most important file to
    look

    at is ''client.py''. This file does all the request preparation, sending request
    and

    receiving response. It is also used by the command line Nova client. </p>'

          : \n \n Pressing the \"+ Launch Stack\" button creates a dialogue that invites\
          \ you to\nprovide a Heat template. \n \n The dialogue offers you three ways\
          \ of providing a template via the \"Template Source\"\ndrop down: \n \n\
          \ \nURL - The template can be reached via a web browser, and you are going\
          \ to\n  provide the URL it can be found at; \n \nFile - You are going to\

          \ \nFile - You are going to upload the environment from your local machine;\
          \ \n \nDirect Input - You will type the environment in by hand. \n \n Again,\
          \ dependant on which selection you make, the dialogue will reconfigure\n\
          itself to allow you to provide the required information. \n An environment\n\
          simply allows you to provide parameter values and to define custom resources.\
          \ \n In this example we are going to use one of the NeCTAR Heat sample templates.\
          \ \n So in the Template Source field select \"URL\", then in the \"Template\
          \ URL\" field\nenter: \n https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NeCTAR-RC/heat-templates/master/juno/Fedora/wordpress_single_instance.yaml\
          \ \n Then in the Environment Source field select \"Direct Input\", then\
          \ in the environment\ndata edit box type the following yaml (taking care\
          \ to enter the correct values): \n ``` \n parameters: \n # your nectar keypair\
          \ name instead of 'nectar_demo' \n key_name: nectar_demo \n # the latest\
          \ nectar fedora image id \n fedora_image_id: db354243-aba2-4831-81c7-a155b9089291\
          \ \n ``` \n Once you are done press the \"Next\" button. \n All going well,\
          \ you should now be presented with a page titled \"Launch Stack\".\nIt will\
          \ be a form that is made up of fields that are taken from your template's\n\
          parameters. \n Next to each field is a small question mark icon. As it gains\
          \ focus, so the user\nwill be shows the parameters comment field as a help\
          \ bubble to the right. \n \n The value entered into the \"Stack Name\" field\
          \ is used to give a name to the stack\nthat is going to be launched by Heat.\
          \ This name must start with a letter and may\nonly contain letters, numbers,\
          \ underscores, full stops and hyphens... \n The \"Creation Timeout (minutes)\"\
          \ field is the number of minutes that should be\nallowed for the stack creation\
          \ to take. If this time is exceeded then the stack\ncreation will be aborted.\
          \ \n The \"Rollback On Failure\" field, if checked, will ensure that the\
          \ complete\nstack gets deleted if there is a failure in creation. If it's\
          \ not checked then\nyou will have to manually delete the stack should there\
          \ be a failure in the creation. \n The rest of the fields are taken from\
          \ the template that has been uploaded.\nYou should find that the values\
          \ you entered in the environment file\nhave been used to fill the fields.\
          \ Otherwise, simply provide the requested\nvalues then select the \"Launch\"\
          \ button. \n All going well, the stack should be created. Once created you\
          \ can select it\nin the lists of stacks that are active, drilling down into\
          \ its\nparticular details. \n When you are finished with a stack, you can\
          \ simply hit the \"Delete\" button\nnext to it on the stack listings. If\
          \ you want to delete more than one\nstack, select the checkboxes next to\

  html: "<h1>Heat: the dashboard</h1>\n<p>On the research cloud <a href=\"https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au/project/\"\
    >dashboard project panel</a>\nthere is a side menu heading named \"Orchestration\"\
    . It has a sub menu entry\ntitled <a href=\"https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au/project/stacks/\"\

    <p>When you select it you will see a list of the stacks that you have created,\
    \ and\nto the top right, a button pair, one labelled \"+ Launch Stack\", the other\n\
    \"\u2716 Delete Stack\":</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Heat stack listing\" src=\"https://github.com/NeCTAR-RC/nectarcloud-tier0doco/blob/master/articles/Cloud\
    \ Expert--DOCID19/Heat--DOCID42/images/heat_dash_stack_listing.png?raw=true\"\
    ></p>\n<p>Pressing the \"+ Launch Stack\" button creates a dialogue that invites\
    \ you to\nprovide a Heat template.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Heat select template dialog\"\
    \ src=\"https://github.com/NeCTAR-RC/nectarcloud-tier0doco/blob/master/articles/Cloud\
    \ Expert--DOCID19/Heat--DOCID42/images/heat_dash_select_template.png?raw=true\"\
    ></p>\n<p>The dialogue offers you three ways of providing a template via the \"\
    Template Source\"\ndrop down:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>URL</code> - The template can\
    \ be reached via a web browser, and you are going to\n  provide the URL it can\
    \ be found at;</li>\n<li><code>File</code> - You are going to upload the template\
    \ from your local machine;</li>\n<li><code>Direct Input</code> - You will type\
    \ the template in by hand.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Dependent on which selection you make\
    \ in the \"Template Source\" drop down, the\ndialogue will reconfigure itself\
    \ to allow you to provide the required information.</p>\n<p>The dialogue also\
    \ offers you the chance to provide an \"Environment Source\".\nThis is also in\
    \ the form of a drop down, but here the choices are limited\nto:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>File</code>\
    \ - You are going to upload the environment from your local machine;</li>\n<li><code>Direct\
    \ Input</code> - You will type the environment in by hand.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Again,\
    \ dependant on which selection you make, the dialogue will reconfigure\nitself\
    \ to allow you to provide the required information.</p>\n<p>An <a href=\"http://docs.openstack.org/developer/heat/template_guide/environment.html\"\
    >environment</a>\nsimply allows you to provide parameter values and to define\
    \ custom resources.</p>\n<p>In this example we are going to use one of the NeCTAR\
    \ Heat sample templates.</p>\n<p>So in the Template Source field select \"URL\"\
    , then in the \"Template URL\" field\nenter:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NeCTAR-RC/heat-templates/master/juno/Fedora/wordpress_single_instance.yaml\"\
    >https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NeCTAR-RC/heat-templates/master/juno/Fedora/wordpress_single_instance.yaml</a></p>\n\
    <p>Then in the Environment Source field select \"Direct Input\", then in the environment\n\
    data edit box type the following <code>yaml</code> (taking care to enter the correct\
    \ values):</p>\n<p>```</p>\n<p>parameters:</p>\n<p># your nectar keypair name\
    \ instead of 'nectar_demo'</p>\n<p>key_name: nectar_demo</p>\n<p># the latest\
    \ nectar fedora image id</p>\n<p>fedora_image_id: db354243-aba2-4831-81c7-a155b9089291</p>\n\
    <p>```</p>\n<p>Once you are done press the \"Next\" button.</p>\n<p>All going\
    \ well, you should now be presented with a page titled \"Launch Stack\".\nIt will\
    \ be a form that is made up of fields that are taken from your template's\nparameters.</p>\n\
    <p>Next to each field is a small question mark icon. As it gains focus, so the\
    \ user\nwill be shows the parameters comment field as a help bubble to the right.</p>\n\
    <p><img alt=\"Heat launch template dialog\" src=\"https://github.com/NeCTAR-RC/nectarcloud-tier0doco/blob/master/articles/Cloud\
    \ Expert--DOCID19/Heat--DOCID42/images/heat_dash_launch.png?raw=true\"></p>\n\
    <p>The value entered into the \"Stack Name\" field is used to give a name to the\
    \ stack\nthat is going to be launched by Heat. This name must start with a letter\
    \ and may\nonly contain letters, numbers, underscores, full stops and hyphens...</p>\n\
    <p>The \"Creation Timeout (minutes)\" field is the number of minutes that should\
    \ be\nallowed for the stack creation to take. If this time is exceeded then the\
    \ stack\ncreation will be aborted.</p>\n<p>The \"Rollback On Failure\" field,\
    \ if checked, will ensure that the complete\nstack gets deleted if there is a\
    \ failure in creation. If it's not checked then\nyou will have to manually delete\
    \ the stack should there be a failure in the creation.</p>\n<p>The rest of the\
    \ fields are taken from the template that has been uploaded.\nYou should find\
    \ that the values you entered in the environment file\nhave been used to fill\
    \ the fields. Otherwise, simply provide the requested\nvalues then select the\
    \ \"Launch\" button.</p>\n<p>All going well, the stack should be created. Once\
    \ created you can select it\nin the lists of stacks that are active, drilling\
    \ down into its\nparticular details.</p>\n<p>When you are finished with a stack,\
    \ you can simply hit the \"Delete\" button\nnext to it on the stack listings.\
    \ If you want to delete more than one\nstack, select the checkboxes next to them\
    \ and hit the \"\u2716 Delete Stack\"\nbutton.</p>"

          \ have installed swift command client in a Linux\nenvironment. If you have\
          \ other operating systems, the debugging process might be\nslightly different,\
          \ however the general rules should still apply. \n Swift command line client\
          \ is very much like other Linux commands; error messages\nare sent to standard\
          \ output, which is the monitor. \n If you get an error, you can always read\
          \ the error message and generally it will\ngive you very good hints about\
          \ what might be wrong. \n For example, if you execute swift list on the\
          \ command line without\nauthentication, the error message might look like\
          \ this: \n \n Auth version 1.0 requires ST_AUTH, ST_USER, and ST_KEY environment\
          \ variables\nto be set or overridden with -A, -U, or -K. \n Auth version\
          \ 2.0 requires OS_AUTH_URL, OS_USERNAME, OS_PASSWORD, and\nOS_TENANT_NAME\
          \ OS_TENANT_ID to be set or overridden with --os-auth-url,\n--os-username,\
          \ --os-password, --os-tenant-name or os-tenant-id. Note:\nadding \"-V 2\"\
          \ is necessary for this. \n \n The above message indicates you that there\
          \ are 2 authentication versions that\nswift currently supports and each\
          \ version requires some environment variables\nto be set. To set these environment\
          \ variables you can either source the script\nfile downloaded from NeCTAR\
          \ Dashboard or you can override it by\nusing command line options. \n You\

          \ Python API takes more effort as it depends on how familiar\nwith Python\

          \ some basic information about how you debug the client Python\nAPI. \n\
          \ You can debug your python code using Python debugger called pdb and you\
          \ can find\nmore information here. \n The following code uses pdb debugger\
          \ to debug a python file contains client python\nAPI code. \n pdb file_name.py\
          \ \n Once you executed the above code, the command line will be stopped\
          \ on the first\nline of code and you can use some commands to control the\
          \ execution flow. \n Some useful ones to use are: \n\n\n\nCommand\nAction\n\
          \n\n\n\nb\nset a breakpoint\n\n\nc\ncontinue debugging until you hit a breakpoint\n\
          \n\ns\nstep through the code\n\n\nn\nto go to next line of code\n\n\nl\n\
          list source code for the current file\n\n\nu\nnavigate up a stack frame\n\
          \n\nd\nnavigate down a stack frame\n\n\np\nto print the value of an expression\
          \ in the current context\n\n\n\n Debugging Via HTTP \n Both command line\
          \ API and python API are accessed via a web service client.\nThus the requests\
          \ are all made by using HTTP and you can always refer to\nOpenStack Service\

          \ requests. The swift API uses requests library\nto send and receive HTTP\
          \ requests/responses. \n For command line client, you can add --debug option\
          \ to print out HTTP request\nheader and HTTP response header, which give\
          \ you a lot of more insight\ninformation. To verify parameters in the request\
          \ header, you can refer to\nOpenStack service API to see what are expected.\
          \ \n To enable debugging information on the standard out for Python API,\
          \ you can add\nthe below code: \n ``` \n import logging \n logger = logging.getLogger(\"\
          swiftclient\") \n logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG) \n ``` \n The\
          \ will print the same output as adding --debug option for command line API.\
          \ \n Debugging via Source Code \n If the above techniques are still not\
          \ helpful, you can always look at the source\ncode to find the problems.\
          \ \n The following source file structure is based on the installation in\
          \ Ubuntu. \n The command line swift command is located in '/usr/bin/swift'.\
          \ By looking at this\nfile, you should get a idea of how the various options\

        description: '<h2>Debugging Swift Command line Client</h2>

          <p>The below assumes you have installed swift command client in a Linux

          environment. If you have other operating systems, the debugging process
          might be

          slightly different, however the general rules should still apply.</p>

          <p>Swift command line client is very much like other Linux commands; error
          messages

          are sent to standard output, which is the monitor.</p>

          <p>If you get an error, you can always read the error message and generally
          it will

          give you very good hints about what might be wrong.</p>

          <p>For example, if you execute <code>swift list</code> on the command line
          without

          authentication, the error message might look like this:</p>

          <blockquote>

          <p>Auth version 1.0 requires ST_AUTH, ST_USER, and ST_KEY environment variables

          to be set or overridden with -A, -U, or -K.</p>

          <p>Auth version 2.0 requires OS_AUTH_URL, OS_USERNAME, OS_PASSWORD, and

          OS_TENANT_NAME OS_TENANT_ID to be set or overridden with --os-auth-url,

          --os-username, --os-password, --os-tenant-name or os-tenant-id. Note:

          adding "-V 2" is necessary for this.</p>

          </blockquote>

          <p>The above message indicates you that there are 2 authentication versions
          that

          swift currently supports and each version requires some environment variables

          to be set. To set these environment variables you can either source the
          script

          file downloaded from NeCTAR <a href="https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au">Dashboard</a>
          or you can override it by

          using command line options.</p>

          <p>You can always execute <code>man swift</code> or simply <code>swift</code>
          to get more help

          information and to learn about supported options.</p>

          <p>If you find a useful command, you can also execute <code>swift command
          --help</code>,

          this will give you more specific help for the command.</p>

          \ \n \n \n Login to NeCTAR Dashboard \n \n \n Select a project from the\
          \ project drop down list and click 'Access & Security',\n your screen should\

          <p>Authentication is the process of verifying the identify of a user that
          is requesting

          to access a computer system. In the context of NeCTAR Cloud, the identities
          of

          users or host computers must be established before accessing the Cloud resources

          such as Dashboard, APIs, Virtual Machines, etc.</p>

          <h2>Methods of Authentication</h2>

          <p>The NecTAR Cloud uses three basic types of authentication for users to
          access

          the Cloud: single sign on authentication (AAF), SSH based authentication

          for virtual machines and token based authentication for APIs.</p>

          <h3>Single Sign on Authentication</h3>

          <p>Single sign on authentication is the process that gives users the ability
          to access

          distributed multiple protected computer system with a single authentication.

          NeCTAR Cloud uses Australian Access Federation (AAF) as the single sign
          on

          authentication solution for access of the Dashboard. The AAF provides the
          ability

          for users to log into a number of eResearch services including NeCTAR Cloud
          using

          the same username and password you would usually use when logging into your

          institution''s or organization''s computer system. The authentications involves

          2 steps, select your institution or organization and provide your username/password.

          <h3>SSH Based Authentication</h3>

          <p>SSH (Secure SHell) based authentication is an alternative way to identify

          yourself to a computer service, rather than typing a username and password.
          It

          is more secure and flexible, but more difficult to set up.</p>

          <p>You generate a key pair, consisting of public key and a private key.
          The private

          key can generate an unique signature and only the relevant public key can

          verify if the signature is genuine.</p>

          <p>After generating a key pair, you copy the public the key to the Virtual
          Machine.

          Then, when the Virtual Machines asks you to prove who you are, you use

          the private key to sign a message and the Virtual Machine can verify the

          signature and allow you to log in. Even if the Virtual Machine is hacked
          and

          your public key is stolen, the public key cannot be used to do authentication

          and you are still safe.</p>

          <p>By default, virtual machines in NeCTAR Cloud uses this authentication
          method and

          it requires you to generate a public/private key pairs before you can login.</p>

          <p>NeCTAR Cloud APIs use Token based authentication. The token is temporary
          and

          short lived, which means it is safer to cache them than username/password

        desc_un_html: " Security API \n The NeCTAR Cloud doesn't provide a specific\
          \ API for security purposes. The only\nsecurity relevant operation is to\
          \ manage security groups through the Nova API.\nIf you want to know the\
          \ Nova API, You can find the related information from the\narticles in the\
          \ 'Instance Management' section. \n This article describes some techniques\
          \ to help you to secure a Linux based\nvirtual machine in the NeCTAR cloud.\
          \ \n As security is a very broad topic, the techniques showed here only\
          \ provides a\nbasic introduction. You can always go to Internet and find\
          \ more useful information\nabout security. \n The instructions below assume\
          \ your operating system is debian/ubuntu. \n Securing SSH \n You need to\
          \ encourage all the users on your system to use SSH certificate\nauthentication\
          \ and disable password login. In addition, you need to avoid logging\ninto\
          \ the system using SSH as root and use alternative methods to become root,\n\
          such as su or sudo. \n To change the SSH configuration, you can edit the\
          \ configuration file on the virtual\nmachine, in '/etc/ssh/sshd_config'.\
          \ \n A basic description of some important configuration items: \n \n \n\
          \ PermitRootLogin no \n You need to set this to 'no' to avoid root access\
          \ via SSH \n \n \n Port 22 \n For better security, you can change the SSH\
          \ port to other port number \n \n \n PermitEmptyPasswords no \n  This should\
          \ be always 'no', for non-empty password access \n \n \n AllowUsers \n \
          \ This directive allows only certain users to have access via SSH to this\
          \ machine. \n \n \n PasswordAuthentication no \n  You should set this to\
          \ 'no' to disable user loggin using password \n \n \n After you have changed\
          \ the '/etc/ssh/sshd_config file', you can execute sudo service ssh restart\n\
          to apply the new changes. \n If you are using an SSH client to access your\
          \ Virtual Machine, you need to make\nsure both SSH server and client are\
          \ using the same version of protocols. \n You can also restrict access to\
          \ file transfer only if you want to allow accounts\non your Virtual Machine\
          \ to transfer files. You can do it by giving users a\nrestricted shell such\
          \ as scpoly or rssh. These shells restrict the commands\navailable to the\
          \ users to execute. You can change an account's shell by editing\n'/etc/passwd'\
          \ file. \n Securing Apache \n If you don't want your Apache web service\
          \ available to public, you can use the\nListen or BindAddress directives\
          \ in '/etc/apache2/apache2.conf'. \n Using Listen:\n    Listen 127.0.0.1:80\n\
          Using BindAddress:\n    BindAddress 127.0.0.1 \n Then you can restart your\
          \ apache service with sudo service apache2 restart \n The default Apache\
          \ installation in Debian permits users to publish content\nunder the '$HOME/public_html'.\
          \ This content can be retrieved remotely using an\nURL such as: http://your_apache_server/~user.\
          \ \n You can restrict the default configuration by editing '/etc/apache2/mods-enabled/userdir.conf'\
          \ \n You can also make sure the permission of log files can only be read/write\
          \ by the\nrequired user and groups. The default permission for the log files\
          \ may be readable\nby anyone. \n By default, Apache web files are located\
          \ under /'var/www'. The default file provides\nsome hints on the system\
          \ like what is the operating system. You should substitute\nthe default\
          \ web pages with your own. \n To further strengthen the Apache security,\
          \ you can run Apache by chroot. See this\ninstruction to set up Apache.\
          \ \n Keep System Update to Date \n In debian/ubuntu, you run sudo apt-get\
          \ update regularly to keep system\nsecurity patch update to date. \n Setup\
          \ Local Firewall \n A local firewall can also be installed with filtering\
          \ rules to protect access to\nthe system. You can use IPtable tools to create\
          \ rules to filter network traffic.\nIt is advised to use Security Group\
          \ to manage which ports to open as it is simple\nto do. The below only provides\
          \ basic introduction to IPtables, for more\ninformation, please refer to\
          \ IPtables MAN page. \n To list all current rules, execute:  sudo iptables\
          \ --list \n By default, the IPtables defines 3 chains. The INPUT Chain is\
          \ for incoming traffic\n, the Forward Chain is for forwarded traffic and\
          \ the OUTPUT Chain is for outgoing\ntraffic. Which chains you need to add\
          \ rules depends on what traffic you want to\nfilter. \n IPtables also defines\
          \ policies that defines actions for rules: \n \n \n Accept, accept traffic\
          \ \n \n \n Reject, reject traffic by sending back an error packet \n \n\
          \ \n Drop, reject traffic by dropping traffic \n \n \n The below shows an\
          \ example how to enable SSH and HTTP/HTTPS traffic in IPtables. \n Firstly,\
          \ you need to allow connections that are already connected to your server:\
          \ \n sudo iptables - I INPUT 1 -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT \n Secondly,\
          \ you need to allow SSH connections: \n sudo iptables -I INPUT 1 -p tcp\
          \ --dport 22 -j ACCEPT \n Thirdly, you can allow HTTP/HTTPS traffic: \n\
          \ sudo iptables -I INPUT 1 -p tcp -dport 80 -j ACCEPT\nsudo iptables -I\
          \ INPUT 1 -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT \n Finally, you need to drop all\
          \ other traffic. You need to make sure you have set\nto allow SSH connection,\
          \ otherwise you will lose access to the Virtual Machine: \n sudo iptables\
          \ -P INPUT DROP \n You can save your IPtables changes by (Ubuntu):  \n iptables-save\
          \ > /etc/iptables.rules \n Install fail2ban \n The SSH daemon itself is\
          \ a Linux service that exposed to the Internet and creates\na security risk\
          \ for the system. fail2ban can mitigate this problem by creating\nrules\
          \ that can automatically alter your your IPtables firewall and ban\nunsuccessful\
          \ login attempts based on a predefined number.  \n You can use the below\
          \ commands to install fail2ban in Ubuntu: \n sudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get\
          \ install fail2ban \n To setup the fail2ban, please follow this instruction.\
          \ \n Disable Unneeded Services \n Unneeded services are a potential security\
          \ risk, so you can execute sudo service --status-all\nto list all available\
          \ services.  You can examine the output carefully and disable\nany services\
          \ not desired. "

          \ 1 -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT</code></p>\n<p>Finally, you need to drop\
          \ all other traffic. You need to make sure you have set\nto allow SSH connection,\
          \ otherwise you will lose access to the Virtual Machine:</p>\n<p><code>sudo\
          \ iptables -P INPUT DROP</code></p>\n<p>You can save your IPtables changes\

  html: "<h2>Security API</h2>\n<p>The NeCTAR Cloud doesn't provide a specific API\
    \ for security purposes. The only\nsecurity relevant operation is to manage security\
    \ groups through the Nova API.\nIf you want to know the Nova API, You can find\
    \ the related information from the\narticles in the 'Instance Management' section.</p>\n\
    <p>This article describes some techniques to help you to secure a Linux based\n\
    virtual machine in the NeCTAR cloud.</p>\n<p>As security is a very broad topic,\
    \ the techniques showed here only provides a\nbasic introduction. You can always\
    \ go to Internet and find more useful information\nabout security.</p>\n<p>The\
    \ instructions below assume your operating system is debian/ubuntu.</p>\n<h2>Securing\
    \ SSH</h2>\n<p>You need to encourage all the users on your system to use SSH certificate\n\
    authentication and disable password login. In addition, you need to avoid logging\n\
    into the system using SSH as root and use alternative methods to become root,\n\
    such as su or sudo.</p>\n<p>To change the SSH configuration, you can edit the\
    \ configuration file on the virtual\nmachine, in '/etc/ssh/sshd_config'.</p>\n\
    <p>A basic description of some important configuration items:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n\
    <p><strong>PermitRootLogin</strong> <strong><em>no</em></strong><br>\n You need\
    \ to set this to 'no' to avoid root access via SSH</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Port\
    \ 22</strong><br>\n For better security, you can change the SSH port to other\
    \ port number</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>PermitEmptyPasswords</strong> <strong><em>no</em></strong><br>\n\
    \  This should be always 'no', for non-empty password access</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\
    <p><strong>AllowUsers</strong><br>\n  This directive allows only certain users\
    \ to have access via SSH to this machine.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>PasswordAuthentication</strong>\
    \ <strong><em>no</em></strong><br>\n  You should set this to 'no' to disable user\
    \ loggin using password</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After you have changed the '/etc/ssh/sshd_config\
    \ file', you can execute <code>sudo service ssh restart</code>\nto apply the new\
    \ changes.</p>\n<p>If you are using an SSH client to access your Virtual Machine,\
    \ you need to make\nsure both SSH server and client are using the same version\
    \ of protocols.</p>\n<p>You can also restrict access to file transfer only if\
    \ you want to allow accounts\non your Virtual Machine to transfer files. You can\
    \ do it by giving users a\nrestricted shell such as scpoly or rssh. These shells\
    \ restrict the commands\navailable to the users to execute. You can change an\
    \ account's shell by editing\n'/etc/passwd' file.</p>\n<h2>Securing Apache</h2>\n\
    <p>If you don't want your Apache web service available to public, you can use\
    \ the\nListen or BindAddress directives in '/etc/apache2/apache2.conf'.</p>\n\
    <p>Using Listen:\n    Listen 127.0.0.1:80\nUsing BindAddress:\n    BindAddress\
    \ 127.0.0.1</p>\n<p>Then you can restart your apache service with <code>sudo service\
    \ apache2 restart</code></p>\n<p>The default Apache installation in Debian permits\
    \ users to publish content\nunder the '$HOME/public_html'. This content can be\
    \ retrieved remotely using an\nURL such as: http://your_apache_server/~user.</p>\n\
    <p>You can restrict the default configuration by editing '/etc/apache2/mods-enabled/userdir.conf'</p>\n\
    <p>You can also make sure the permission of log files can only be read/write by\
    \ the\nrequired user and groups. The default permission for the log files may\
    \ be readable\nby anyone.</p>\n<p>By default, Apache web files are located under\
    \ /'var/www'. The default file provides\nsome hints on the system like what is\
    \ the operating system. You should substitute\nthe default web pages with your\
    \ own.</p>\n<p>To further strengthen the Apache security, you can run Apache by\
    \ chroot. See this\n<a href=\"https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ap-chroot-apache-env.en.html\"\
    >instruction</a> to set up Apache.</p>\n<h2>Keep System Update to Date</h2>\n\
    <p>In debian/ubuntu, you run <code>sudo apt-get update</code> regularly to keep\
    \ system\nsecurity patch update to date.</p>\n<h2>Setup Local Firewall</h2>\n\
    <p>A local firewall can also be installed with filtering rules to protect access\
    \ to\nthe system. You can use IPtable tools to create rules to filter network\
    \ traffic.\nIt is advised to use Security Group to manage which ports to open\
    \ as it is simple\nto do. The below only provides basic introduction to IPtables,\
    \ for more\ninformation, please refer to IPtables <a href=\"http://linux.die.net/man/8/iptables\"\
    >MAN page</a>.</p>\n<p>To list all current rules, execute:  <code>sudo iptables\
    \ --list</code></p>\n<p>By default, the IPtables defines 3 chains. The INPUT Chain\
    \ is for incoming traffic\n, the Forward Chain is for forwarded traffic and the\
    \ OUTPUT Chain is for outgoing\ntraffic. Which chains you need to add rules depends\
    \ on what traffic you want to\nfilter.</p>\n<p>IPtables also defines policies\
    \ that defines actions for rules:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Accept</strong>,\
    \ accept traffic</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Reject</strong>, reject traffic\
    \ by sending back an error packet</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Drop</strong>,\
    \ reject traffic by dropping traffic</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The below shows an\
    \ example how to enable SSH and HTTP/HTTPS traffic in IPtables.</p>\n<p>Firstly,\
    \ you need to allow connections that are already connected to your server:</p>\n\
    <p><code>sudo iptables - I INPUT 1 -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT</code></p>\n<p>Secondly,\
    \ you need to allow SSH connections:</p>\n<p><code>sudo iptables -I INPUT 1 -p\
    \ tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT</code></p>\n<p>Thirdly, you can allow HTTP/HTTPS traffic:</p>\n\
    <p><code>sudo iptables -I INPUT 1 -p tcp -dport 80 -j ACCEPT</code>\n<code>sudo\
    \ iptables -I INPUT 1 -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT</code></p>\n<p>Finally, you\
    \ need to drop all other traffic. You need to make sure you have set\nto allow\
    \ SSH connection, otherwise you will lose access to the Virtual Machine:</p>\n\
    <p><code>sudo iptables -P INPUT DROP</code></p>\n<p>You can save your IPtables\
    \ changes by (Ubuntu): </p>\n<p><code>iptables-save &gt; /etc/iptables.rules</code></p>\n\

        desc_un_html: " Debugging Dashboard Authentication \n The NeCTAR Dashboard\
          \ uses Australian Access Federation for its authentication.\nIf you have\
          \ any problems with the login, you can contact the IT helpdesk in your\n\
          local organization or institution. You can log a ticket in the NeCTAR\n\
          helpdesk. You can also submit a help request to aaf\nhelpdesk for help.\
          \ \n Debugging API Authentication \n You must first send an authentication\
          \ request to OpenStack Identity service to\nget an authentication token\
          \ before you can access API services. To request an\nauthentication token,\
          \ you must supply the credentials in the authentication request. \n The\
          \ credentials are a combination of username, password and project name.\
          \ You also\nneed to get the authentication URL for credentials validation.\
          \ \n You need to make sure you have the correct Credentials download from\
          \ the NeCTAR\nDashboard. Before you use them, please check the username,\
          \ projet name and the\nAPI endpoints. You can reference these information\
          \ from the script file you\nobtained from the NeCTAR Dashboard. \n After\
          \ you send the username/password and project name to the authentication\
          \ URL,\nYou will get a authentication token. Then, you need to include the\
          \ token in the\nX-Auth-Token HTTP header. If you access multiple API services,\
          \ you must get a\ntoken for each API service. The token has a limited time\
          \ and can become invalid\nfor other reasons. \n Authentication and API request\
          \ workflow \n \n \n Send a request with credentials to get a token from\
          \ the Identity endpoint. If\n the request succeeds, the server returns an\
          \ authentication token. \n \n \n Send API requests and include the token\
          \ in the X-Auth-Token HTTP header. The\n following HTTP requests use the\
          \ same token until the requests complete. \n \n \n If a 401 Unauthorized\
          \ error returned, the request requires a new token. \n \n \n Debug Authentication\
          \ \n The below use cURL commands to show your how to debug authentication\
          \ request.\nFor information about cURL, see http://curl.haxx.se/. For information\n\
          about the OpenStack APIs, see OpenStack API Reference. \n To get a valid\
          \ token, you need 3 parameters: \n \n \n username \n \n \n password \n \n\
          \ \n project name/project id \n \n \n The below shows a code to get token:\
          \ \n ``` \n curl -s -X POST https://keystone.rc.nectar.org.au:5000/v2.0/tokens\
          \ \\ \n         -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n\n        -d '{\"\
          auth\": {\"tenantName\": \"'\"$OS_TENANT_NAME\"'\", \"passwordCredentials\"\
          :\n\n        {\"username\": \"'\"$OS_USERNAME\"'\", \"password\": \"'\"\
          $OS_PASSWORD\"'\"}}}' \\\n\n        | python -m json.tool\n \n ``` \n You\
          \ need to replace the username, password and tenantname with the values\
          \ in\nthe authentication script file you obtained from the NeCTAR Dashboard.\
          \ \n The response would look like below: \n ``` \n {\n    \"access\": {\n\

        description: "<h2>Debugging Dashboard Authentication</h2>\n<p>The NeCTAR Dashboard\
          \ uses <a href=\"http://aaf.edu.au/\">Australian Access Federation</a> for\
          \ its authentication.\nIf you have any problems with the login, you can\
          \ contact the IT helpdesk in your\nlocal organization or institution. You\
          \ can log a ticket in the NeCTAR\n<a href=\"https://support.nectar.org.au/support/home\"\
          >helpdesk</a>. You can also submit a help request to aaf\n<a href=\"http://support.aaf.edu.au/home\"\
          >helpdesk</a> for help.</p>\n<h2>Debugging API Authentication</h2>\n<p>You\
          \ must first send an authentication request to OpenStack Identity service\
          \ to\nget an authentication token before you can access API services. To\
          \ request an\nauthentication token, you must supply the credentials in the\
          \ authentication request.</p>\n<p>The credentials are a combination of username,\
          \ password and project name. You also\nneed to get the authentication URL\
          \ for credentials validation.</p>\n<p>You need to make sure you have the\
          \ correct Credentials download from the NeCTAR\nDashboard. Before you use\
          \ them, please check the username, projet name and the\nAPI endpoints. You\
          \ can reference these information from the script file you\nobtained from\
          \ the NeCTAR Dashboard.</p>\n<p>After you send the username/password and\
          \ project name to the authentication URL,\nYou will get a authentication\
          \ token. Then, you need to include the token in the\nX-Auth-Token HTTP header.\
          \ If you access multiple API services, you must get a\ntoken for each API\
          \ service. The token has a limited time and can become invalid\nfor other\
          \ reasons.</p>\n<h3>Authentication and API request workflow</h3>\n<ul>\n\
          <li>\n<p>Send a request with credentials to get a token from the Identity\
          \ endpoint. If\n the request succeeds, the server returns an authentication\
          \ token.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Send API requests and include the token in\
          \ the X-Auth-Token HTTP header. The\n following HTTP requests use the same\
          \ token until the requests complete.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If a 401 Unauthorized\
          \ error returned, the request requires a new token.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\
          <h3>Debug Authentication</h3>\n<p>The below use cURL commands to show your\
          \ how to debug authentication request.\nFor information about cURL, see\
          \ <a href=\"http://curl.haxx.se/\">http://curl.haxx.se/</a>. For information\n\
          about the OpenStack APIs, see <a href=\"http://developer.openstack.org/api-ref.html\"\
          >OpenStack API Reference</a>.</p>\n<p>To get a valid token, you need 3 parameters:</p>\n\
          <ul>\n<li>\n<p>username</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>password</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\
          <p>project name/project id</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The below shows a code\
          \ to get token:</p>\n<p>```</p>\n<p>curl -s -X POST https://keystone.rc.nectar.org.au:5000/v2.0/tokens\

  html: "<h2>Debugging Dashboard Authentication</h2>\n<p>The NeCTAR Dashboard uses\
    \ <a href=\"http://aaf.edu.au/\">Australian Access Federation</a> for its authentication.\n\
    If you have any problems with the login, you can contact the IT helpdesk in your\n\
    local organization or institution. You can log a ticket in the NeCTAR\n<a href=\"\
    https://support.nectar.org.au/support/home\">helpdesk</a>. You can also submit\
    \ a help request to aaf\n<a href=\"http://support.aaf.edu.au/home\">helpdesk</a>\
    \ for help.</p>\n<h2>Debugging API Authentication</h2>\n<p>You must first send\
    \ an authentication request to OpenStack Identity service to\nget an authentication\
    \ token before you can access API services. To request an\nauthentication token,\
    \ you must supply the credentials in the authentication request.</p>\n<p>The credentials\
    \ are a combination of username, password and project name. You also\nneed to\
    \ get the authentication URL for credentials validation.</p>\n<p>You need to make\
    \ sure you have the correct Credentials download from the NeCTAR\nDashboard. Before\
    \ you use them, please check the username, projet name and the\nAPI endpoints.\
    \ You can reference these information from the script file you\nobtained from\
    \ the NeCTAR Dashboard.</p>\n<p>After you send the username/password and project\
    \ name to the authentication URL,\nYou will get a authentication token. Then,\
    \ you need to include the token in the\nX-Auth-Token HTTP header. If you access\
    \ multiple API services, you must get a\ntoken for each API service. The token\
    \ has a limited time and can become invalid\nfor other reasons.</p>\n<h3>Authentication\
    \ and API request workflow</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Send a request with credentials\
    \ to get a token from the Identity endpoint. If\n the request succeeds, the server\
    \ returns an authentication token.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Send API requests and\
    \ include the token in the X-Auth-Token HTTP header. The\n following HTTP requests\
    \ use the same token until the requests complete.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If a 401\
    \ Unauthorized error returned, the request requires a new token.</p>\n</li>\n\
    </ul>\n<h3>Debug Authentication</h3>\n<p>The below use cURL commands to show your\
    \ how to debug authentication request.\nFor information about cURL, see <a href=\"\
    http://curl.haxx.se/\">http://curl.haxx.se/</a>. For information\nabout the OpenStack\
    \ APIs, see <a href=\"http://developer.openstack.org/api-ref.html\">OpenStack\
    \ API Reference</a>.</p>\n<p>To get a valid token, you need 3 parameters:</p>\n\
    <ul>\n<li>\n<p>username</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>password</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>project\
    \ name/project id</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The below shows a code to get token:</p>\n\
    <p>```</p>\n<p>curl -s -X POST https://keystone.rc.nectar.org.au:5000/v2.0/tokens\
    \ \\</p>\n<pre><code>        -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n\n    \
    \    -d '{\"auth\": {\"tenantName\": \"'\"$OS_TENANT_NAME\"'\", \"passwordCredentials\"\
    :\n\n        {\"username\": \"'\"$OS_USERNAME\"'\", \"password\": \"'\"$OS_PASSWORD\"\
    '\"}}}' \\\n\n        | python -m json.tool\n</code></pre>\n<p>```</p>\n<p>You\
    \ need to replace the username, password and tenantname with the values in\nthe\
    \ authentication script file you obtained from the NeCTAR Dashboard.</p>\n<p>The\
    \ response would look like below:</p>\n<p>```</p>\n<p>{\n    \"access\": {\n \
    \       \"metadata\": {\n            \"is_admin\": 0,\n            \"roles\":\

    user\": {\n            \"id\": \"\",\n            \"name\": \"\",\n          \

    \      \"username\": \"\"\n        }\n    }\n}</p>\n<p>```</p>\n<p>Then you can\
    \ use the token obtained from this output in the API for authentication.</p>\n\
    <p>Following is an example of how to use the token in using Nova API to list flavors:</p>\n\
    <p>```</p>\n<p>curl -s -H \\</p>\n<pre><code>        \"X-Auth-Token:token\" \\\
    \n\n        http://8.21.28.222:8774/v2/tenant_id/flavors \\\n\n        | python\
    \ -m json.tool\n</code></pre>\n<p>```</p>\n<p>You need to replace the token and\
    \ the URL. You can find the Nova API endpoint\nURL from the NeCTAR <a href=\"\
    https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au\">Dashboard</a>. The above request would return\
    \ the\nfollowing output:</p>\n<p>```</p>\n<p>{\n    \"flavors\": [\n        {\n\

          \ Storage \n Backing Up Data \n \n See Training Module 9 for more detail\
          \ on snapshots and backups. \n About Snapshots \n A snapshot is a way to\
          \ create a copy of the disk state of your virtual machine (VM). \nThere\
          \ are two main reasons you would take a snapshot of your VM: \n \n To back-up\
          \ the VM set-up - you can restore an instance from the snapshot \n To create\
          \ a template image which can be used to launch instances which are already\
          \ set-up. \n \n NOTE: The snapshot only creates an image of the primary\
          \ 'root' disk, not the secondary 'ephemeral' storage or mounted volumes.\
          \ \n The primary 'root' disk is small (5-30GB) and is not suitable for storing\
          \ significant data. \nCreating an image of your VM is preserving the computer\
          \ set-up such as software installation,\nconfigurations and profiles. Backing\
          \ up data will be covered later in this article. \n \n Creating a Snapshot\
          \ of an Instance (an Image) \n \n Log on to the NeCTAR Dashboard and click\
          \ on the 'Instances' tab \n It is not necessary, but good practice, to 'pause\
          \ instance' from the 'Actions' drop down list. \n Click 'Create Snapshot'\
          \ from the 'Actions' drop down list. \n Enter a descriptive name for the\
          \ Snapshot \n It will now take some time to create the Snapshot.  \n The\
          \ snapshotted image will be saved in the 'Project' tab of the 'Images' section.\
          \ \n \n Launching an Instance from a saved Image \n \n On the NeCTAR Dashboard,\
          \ navigate to 'Images'\n \n Choose the 'Project' tab \n Click 'Launch' in\
          \ the 'Actions' list for the image you wish to restore. \n You can choose\
          \ a different 'Flavour' (i.e. size) of instance, but it must be large \n\
          \ enough to fit the image on the primary 'root' disk. \n Name the instance,\
          \ set the keypair and security groups in the 'Access and Security' tab,\n\
          \ and set the 'Availability Zone' if necessary (e.g. to ensure the same\
          \ zone as your volume storage). \n This is just like launching a new instance,\
          \ except that the new VM will already have the settings,\n configurations\
          \ and installations of the original VM. \n Access as per usual, with SSH\
          \ keys and the IP address of the new instance. \n \n NOTE: The new VM will\
          \ have a new, empty secondary 'ephemeral' storage disk. This will\nneed\
          \ to be made writable with the command: \nsudo chown ubuntu /mnt \n If required,\
          \ existing volume storage will need to be attached, mounted and made writable\
          \ also.  \nAttach on the NeCTAR Dashboard -> Volumes -> Edit Attachments\
          \ \nThen access the VM command line and enter: \nsudo mkdir /volume_name\
          \ \nsudo mount /dev/vdc /volume_name -t auto \nsudo chown ubuntu /volume_name\
          \ \n \n \n Snapshots of Volume Storage \n Snapshots can also be made to\
          \ copy the disk state of your Volume block storage.\nThis is useful for\
          \ preserving the state of your Volume in an image, in order to \ncreate\
          \ a new Volume from it at a later time. The volume snapshots use up your\
          \ volume\ndata allocation, for the full size of the volume. Volume snapshots\
          \ are not designed as a method of\nbacking up data - see data backup suggestions\
          \ later in this article. \n \n On the NeCTAR Dashboard, navigate to 'Volumes'\n\
          \ \n The volume should be unnattached from an instance: Click 'Edit Attachments'\n\
          \ in the 'Actions' list, then 'Detach Volume'. \n Click 'Create Snapshot'\
          \ in the 'Actions' list. \n \n The snapshot is found in the 'Volume Snapshots'\
          \ tab. \n \n \n In the 'Actions' drop down list, you can create a new volume\
          \ from the snapshot,\n edit the name, or delete the snapshot when it is\
          \ no longer needed (to recover the volume storage space it uses). \n \n\
          \ \n \n Backing Up your Data \n \n As discussed earlier in this article,\
          \ Instance snapshots don't copy the larger disks\nthat are used for data\
          \ storage, and Volume snapshots are inefficient as a data back-up strategy.\
          \ \n The source for the back-up will be the secondary 'ephemeral' storage\
          \ disk, or\nfrom volume block storage. \n The destination for the back-up\
          \ may be your local computer, or a data storage \nserver at your research\
          \ organisation. \n Compressed File Transfers \n The simplest back-up is\
          \ to compress a directory and transfer it from your VM to your back-up destination.\
          \ \n The general comand structure to compress files: \ntar -cvpzf <NameOfArchive>.tar.gz\
          \ <list of your files or folders> \n To copy a directory ( /mnt/data ) into\
          \ a single, compressed file ( data.tar.gz ):  \n tar -cvpzf data.tar.gz\
          \ /mnt/data \n The compressed file can be transferred to another computer\
          \ using FileZilla (for a local\ncomputer back-up), or SCP to back-up on\
          \ a remote server (see the Cloud Basics article: Transferring Data) \n scp\
          \ <Path_To_Source_File> <Path_to_Destination>   \n e.g. scp ~/data.tar.gz\
          \ username@remote.host.edu.au:data/directory \nor, scp -i path/to/key ~/data.tar.gz\
          \ username@remote.host.edu.au:data/directory  \n Backing up with RSYNC \n\
          \ This is a utility that creates incremental backups, such that the most\
          \ recent synced state \nof a source directory is 'mirrored' in a directory\
          \ on the destination storage device. \n Syncing is a more efficient way\
          \ of backing up data, as after the first sync, only modifications to the\
          \ files will be transferred. \n \n RSYNC must be installed on the source\
          \ computer (the VM) and the destination computer. \n RSYNC is pre-installed\
          \ on MacOSX \n On Ubuntu, enter sudo apt-get install rsync\n \n On Windows,\
          \ installation is through the Cygwin package and usage is more complicated.\
          \ \n \n The general command for creating or syncing the back-up:   \n rsync\
          \ -av <source directory> <destination directory> \nor, \nrsync -av -e -i\
          \ <path-to-private-key> <source directory> <destination directory> \n To\
          \ sync from the Terminal app. on your local computer, from the directory\
          \ you are syncing into: \n rsync -av ubuntu@NNN.NNN.NNN.NNN:/mnt/data/ dataCopy/\
          \  (this syncs data from the VM) \nrsync -av dataCopy/ ubuntu@NNN.NNN.NNN.NNN:/mnt/data/\
          \ (this will restore data to the VM) \n To sync from the VM command line\
          \ to a remote server: \nrsync -av /mnt/data/ username@remote.host.edu.au:data/directory/\
          \   \n and to restore:  \nrsync -av username@remote.host.edu.au:data/directory/\
          \ /mnt/data/   \n Backing up Volumes to the Object Storage \n This can be\
          \ done with OpenStack commands. See Training Module 10 for instructions\n\
          on using OpenStack commands to manage your cloud computing. "

          \ or delete the snapshot when it is no longer needed (to recover the volume\
          \ storage space it uses).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2>Backing Up your Data\
          \ <a name=\"Backup\"></a>\n</h2>\n<p>As discussed earlier in this article,\
          \ Instance snapshots don't copy the larger disks\nthat are used for data\
          \ storage, and Volume snapshots are inefficient as a data back-up strategy.</p>\n\
          <p>The <strong>source</strong> for the back-up will be the secondary 'ephemeral'\
          \ storage disk, or\nfrom volume block storage.</p>\n<p>The <strong>destination</strong>\
          \ for the back-up may be your local computer, or a data storage \nserver\
          \ at your research organisation.</p>\n<h3>Compressed File Transfers</h3>\n\
          <p>The simplest back-up is to compress a directory and transfer it from\
          \ your VM to your back-up destination.</p>\n<p>The general comand structure\
          \ to compress files:<br>\n<code>tar -cvpzf &lt;NameOfArchive&gt;.tar.gz\
          \ &lt;list of your files or folders&gt;</code></p>\n<p>To copy a directory\
          \ ( /mnt/data ) into a single, compressed file ( data.tar.gz ): </p>\n<p><code>tar\
          \ -cvpzf data.tar.gz /mnt/data</code></p>\n<p>The compressed file can be\
          \ transferred to another computer using FileZilla (for a local\ncomputer\
          \ back-up), or SCP to back-up on a remote server (see the Cloud Basics article:\
          \ Transferring Data)</p>\n<p><code>scp &lt;Path_To_Source_File&gt; &lt;Path_to_Destination&gt;</code>\
          \  </p>\n<p>e.g. <code>scp ~/data.tar.gz username@remote.host.edu.au:data/directory</code><br>\n\
          or, <code>scp -i path/to/key ~/data.tar.gz username@remote.host.edu.au:data/directory</code>\
          \ </p>\n<h3>Backing up with RSYNC</h3>\n<p>This is a utility that creates\
          \ incremental backups, such that the most recent synced state \nof a source\
          \ directory is 'mirrored' in a directory on the destination storage device.</p>\n\
          <p>Syncing is a more efficient way of backing up data, as after the first\
          \ sync, only modifications to the files will be transferred.</p>\n<ul>\n\
          <li>RSYNC must be installed on the source computer (the VM) and the destination\
          \ computer.</li>\n<li>RSYNC is pre-installed on MacOSX</li>\n<li>On Ubuntu,\
          \ enter <code>sudo apt-get install rsync</code>\n</li>\n<li>On Windows,\
          \ installation is through the <a href=\"https://www.cygwin.com/\">Cygwin\
          \ package</a> and usage is more complicated.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The general\
          \ command for creating or syncing the back-up:  </p>\n<p><code>rsync -av\
          \ &lt;source directory&gt; &lt;destination directory&gt;</code><br>\nor,<br>\n\
          <code>rsync -av -e -i &lt;path-to-private-key&gt; &lt;source directory&gt;\
          \ &lt;destination directory&gt;</code></p>\n<p>To sync from the Terminal\
          \ app. on your local computer, from the directory you are syncing into:</p>\n\
          <p><code>rsync -av ubuntu@NNN.NNN.NNN.NNN:/mnt/data/ dataCopy/</code>  (this\
          \ syncs data from the VM)<br>\n<code>rsync -av dataCopy/ ubuntu@NNN.NNN.NNN.NNN:/mnt/data/</code>\
          \ (this will restore data to the VM)</p>\n<p>To sync from the VM command\
          \ line to a remote server:<br>\n<code>rsync -av /mnt/data/ username@remote.host.edu.au:data/directory/</code>\
          \  </p>\n<p>and to restore: <br>\n<code>rsync -av username@remote.host.edu.au:data/directory/\

    \ Snapshots</h2>\n<p>A snapshot is a way to create a copy of the disk state of\
    \ your virtual machine (VM).<br>\nThere are two main reasons you would take a\
    \ snapshot of your VM:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>To <strong>back-up the VM set-up</strong>\
    \ - you can restore an instance from the snapshot</li>\n<li>To create a <strong>template\
    \ image</strong> which can be used to launch instances which are already set-up.</li>\n\
    </ol>\n<p>NOTE: The snapshot only creates an image of the primary 'root' disk,\
    \ not the secondary 'ephemeral' storage or mounted volumes.</p>\n<p>The primary\
    \ 'root' disk is small (5-30GB) and is not suitable for storing significant data.\
    \ \nCreating an image of your VM is preserving the computer set-up such as software\
    \ installation,\nconfigurations and profiles. <a href=\"#Backup\">Backing up data\
    \ will be covered later in this article</a>.</p>\n<p><a name='Instance'></a></p>\n\

          \ or directories, etc. \n \n \n \n \n SCP: secure copy \n \n SCP is a simple\
          \ method for transferring files between computers.  \n The basic command\
          \ for Secure Copy is like a UNIX cp, but adding a connection to a different\
          \ computer in the file path \n scp <Path_To_Source_File> <Path_to_Destination>\
          \ \n Between a local Mac/Linux and the VM \n Enter the command from your\
          \ local computer's Terminal app.  \n To upload a file to the VM: \n scp\
          \ -i ~/.ssh/Nectar_Key <local-file-path> ubuntu@NNN.NNN.NNN.NNN:<instance-file-path>\
          \ \n To download a file from your VM: \n scp -i ~/.ssh/Nectar_Key ubuntu@NNN.NNN.NNN.NNN:<instance-file-path>\
          \ <local-file-path> \n Between your VM and a data storage server \n If you\
          \ have data stored on a remote server, you can transfer files between it\
          \ and the VM through the command-line on the VM. \n You will need a host\
          \ address for the data storage server, and your username, plus usually a\
          \ password. \n scp username@host.address.edu.au:/data/myDirectory/file.txt\
          \ /mnt/data/ \nscp /mnt/data/results.zip username@host.address.edu.au:/data/myDirectory/\
          \ \n You will usually then be prompted to enter the password for your data\
          \ storage. \n n.b. use scp -i path/to/key ... if your remote server has\
          \ ssh keys rather than password access. \n \n SFTP via the Command Line\
          \ \n \n Secure file transfer is also available between the VM and remote\
          \ data storage. \n Enter the 'sftp' command on your VM, and you will have\
          \ access to the remote host. \n sftp username@host.address.edu.au   - you\
          \ will usually be prompted for a password. \n or \n sftp -i path/to/key\
          \ username@host.address.edu.au  - if the remote server has ssh key authentication\
          \ \n You are now accessing the remote data storage server, and you can navigate\
          \ the files on the server\nas per usual with commands like cd and ls. \n\
          \ The commands get and put will transfer data between the machines: \n get\
          \ <remote_server_file.txt> </mnt/localVM_destination/> \n put </mnt/localVM_destination/file.txt>\
          \ <remote_directory/> \n to close the sftp connection, type exit. "
