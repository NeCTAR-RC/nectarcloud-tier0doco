        desc_un_html: " This guide describes launching a running instance (virtual\
          \ machine) with SSH login\nenabled. \n Preparation \n You need to create\
          \ a public/private key pair before you can use SSH to login to \nthe newly\
          \ created instance. The public key will be inserted into the instance and\n\
          the private key is used on your desktop/laptop. \n Windows User \n Use PuTTYgen\
          \ key generator to generate the required key pair. \n \n \n Download PuTTYgen\
          \ (puttygen.exe) from PuTTYgen download page \n \n \n Launch the PuTTYgen\
          \ application by double clicking the puttygen.exe \n \n \n The default settings\
          \ are fine for this case, click the 'Generate' button \n \n \n Save your\
          \ public key by clicking 'Save public key' button. You should give a\n name\
          \ that will help identify the key in the future \n \n \n Save your private\
          \ key by clicking 'Save private key' button. You should give\n a sensible\
          \ name for future reference. The passphrase can provide additional\n security,\
          \ though can be left empty. \n \n \n Linux/Mac User \n Type ssh-keygen in\
          \ the terminal and enter. This generates a public key\n(id_rsa.pub) and\
          \ a private key (id_rsa). By default, the two keys are\nlocated in ~/.ssh\
          \ \n Import Public Key \n The public key generated by Windows/Linux/Mac\
          \ are required to be imported into\nthe Nectar Cloud dashboard before use.\
          \ \n \n \n Log into the Cloud Dashboard \n \n \n Go to the Access and Security\
          \ tab and then to the Keypairs page \n \n \n Click 'Import Key Pair' button\
          \ \n \n \n Type in a keypair name and paste the contents of the public key.\
          \ For Windows\n users, open PuTTYgen and click 'Load' button to load the\
          \ related private key and\n copy/paste the public key contents. For Linux/Mac\
          \ user, type\n cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub and copy/paste the public key contents\
          \ from the terminal\n output \n \n \n Nectar Cloud Dashboard \n Key pairs\
          \ can also be created directly through the Nectar Cloud Dashboard. \n \n\
          \ \n Login to the Cloud Dashboard \n \n \n Go to the Access and Security\
          \ tab and then to the Keypairs page \n \n \n Click the 'Create Key Pair'\
          \ button \n \n \n Type in a keypair name in the popup window and click the\
          \ 'Create Key Pair'\n button \n \n \n Save the private key into a directory\
          \ \n \n \n Notes: If you are running a Windows machine the SSH private key\
          \ will need to be\nconverted (use PuTTYgen for converting keys) \n \n \n\
          \ Open PuTTYgen \n \n \n Click 'Load' button to load the private key generated\
          \ by the Cloud Dashboard \n \n \n Click 'Export OpenSSH key' from 'Conversions'\
          \ menu \n \n \n Type a private key name and save \n \n \n Select an Image\
          \ \n You need to select an image to be used for your instance. The image\
          \ defines what\noperating system the instance uses and thus you need to\
          \ select an image based on\nyour needs. Nectar Cloud offers a list of official\
          \ images and for\nsimplicity, these images are recommended. You can find\
          \ a complete list of\nofficial images from Nectar image catalog. You can\
          \ also find all\navailable images from the Cloud Dashboard. \n \n \n Login\
          \ to the Cloud Dashboard \n \n \n Go to the Dashboard Images tab \n \n \n\
          \ For advanced users, you can also create your own images. Please refer\
          \ to\nthe openstack documentation for more details. \n Configure Instance\
          \ \n Before you can launch an instance, you need to configure the below\
          \ options: \n Details \n \n \n Instance Name: the name used by the dashboard\
          \ to identify the instance \n \n \n Flavour: the resources available for\
          \ the instance. It specifies the number of\n VCPUs, size of root disk, size\
          \ of ephemeral disk and size of RAM.\n Your allocated flavour or lesser\
          \ configurations can be selected (the\n default is m2.tiny; a 1 VCPU machine)\
          \ \n \n \n Instance Count: number of instance to launch (the default is\
          \ 1) \n \n \n Instance Boot Source: the media used to boot the instance.\
          \ You can boot from\n image, snapshot and volume (the default is boot from\
          \ image) \n \n \n Boot from image: Boot instance using an image \n \n \n\
          \ Boot from snapshot: Boot instance using a snapshot \n \n \n Boot from\
          \ volume: Boot instance from volume storage \n \n \n Image Name: the name\
          \ of an Image. This option is used when the Instance Boot\n Source is 'Boot\
          \ from image' \n \n \n Access & Security \n \n \n Key Pair: the public/private\
          \ keys used to log into the instance. See above to\n see how to create them.\
          \ This can't be added or changed after the instance is\n created. \n \n\
          \ \n Security Groups: add network access to your instances. This determines\
          \ what\n services can be accessed on the instance. You must select 'SSH'\
          \ Security Groups\n to allow you to login via SSH. If 'SSH' Security Groups\
          \ is not available, you\n can create it by going to Access & Security tab\
          \ on the right hand side of the\n Cloud Dashboard. The default Security\
          \ Group (no network access at first) is\n pre-selected \n \n \n To create\
          \ a Security Group: \n \n \n Login to the Cloud Dashboard \n \n \n Go to\
          \ the Access & Security tab \n \n \n Click 'Create Security Group' button\
          \ \n \n \n Give a name for the Security Group \n \n \n Give a meaningful\
          \ description for the Security Group \n \n \n Click 'Create Security Group'\
          \ button \n \n \n The newly created Security Group has no rules added (no\
          \ network access defined).\nTo add rules to a Security Group: \n \n \n Go\
          \ to the Access & Security tab \n \n \n Tick to select the Security Group\
          \ to add rules \n \n \n Click 'Manage Rules' button \n \n \n Click 'Add\
          \ Rule' button \n \n \n Select what type of Rule you want to create \n \n\
          \ \n Select from 'Open Port' the 'Port' option to open one single port,\
          \ or 'Port Range'\n to open a range of ports \n \n \n The 'Remote' option\
          \ specifies the source of the traffic to be allowed via this\n rule. You\
          \ may do so either in the form of an IP address block (CIDR) or via a\n\
          \ source group (Security Group). \n \n \n Click 'Add' button \n \n \n You\
          \ can also click 'Delete Rule' button to delete a rule \n Availability Zone\
          \ \n Select the Availability Zone for your instance. The Availability Zone\
          \ is the\nlocation for your instance. By default, the system will select\
          \ an available\nlocation for you. You can also click the 'Advanced' button\
          \ to select from a\ncomplete list of available Availability Zones \n Post-Creation\
          \ \n You can execute a customization script after you launch your instance.\
          \ You can\ndo any initialization and customization to your instance by using\
          \ this and it\nis executed only once at the first boot of your instance.\
          \ You can copy/paste\nyour script by selecting 'Direct Input' or you can\
          \ upload a script file. The\nscript can be a shell script or Cloud-init\
          \ script. \n Advanced Options \n You can choose whether you automaticly\
          \ or manually create the disk partition.\nIn most cases, you shouldn't change\
          \ the default. \n Notes: The above configuration options can be set in the\
          \ 'Launch Instance' popup\nwindow. To launch the popup window, you can go\
          \ to the Instances tab and\nclick 'Launch Instance' button. \n To get more\
          \ information about the terms used, please refer to\nthe glossary. \n Example\
          \ Launch of an Instance \n \n \n Login to the Cloud Dashboard \n \n \n Go\
          \ to Dashboard Instances tab \n \n \n Click 'Launch Instance' button \n\
          \ \n \n Type instance name \n \n \n Select a flavour. Flavour indicates\
          \ the specification of a instance. You can\n find more information in the\
          \ Flavour Details. \n \n \n Select an NeCTAR offical image (we suggest selecting\
          \ an Ubuntu image such as\n NeCTAR Ubuntu 14.10 (Utopic) amd64) \n \n \n\
          \ Click Access & Security tab \n \n \n Select a key pair created earlier\
          \ \n \n \n Select security groups to use. Tick 'ssh' and 'http' (these are\
          \ pre-defined\n groups in the default personal project) \n \n \n Click Availability\
          \ Zone \n \n \n Select the location of your instance or leave as unselected\
          \ (the system will\n auto select available location) \n \n \n Click launch\
          \ button and the page will change to the Instances Tab \n \n \n After a\
          \ while (usually a couple of minutes), your instance will become active\n\
          \ and will have an IP address. The IP address is available in the Instances\
          \ table\n on your Nectar Dashboard. \n \n \n The launch button begins Cloud\
          \ provisioning and initialisation of a running\ninstance from the selected\
          \ image and your configuration options. The instance\nwill normally pass\
          \ from status \"Build\" to \"Active\". Depending on your image\nsize and\
          \ cloud activity, the length of time required may vary. Your instance\n\
          will have a public IP address and be reachable according to the\nSecurity\
          \ Groups selected. \n You can connect to your new instance via\nAccessing\
          \ Your Instance \n If Launch is Unsuccessful \n You may get a message that\
          \ your quota has been exceeded or you have\ninsufficient resources. Check\
          \ the table to the right on the Launch Instance page\nfor the number of\
          \ instances you may run simultaneously, then check the\nInstances tab to\
          \ see how many Instances you already have running. You may have\nto terminate\
          \ a running Instance to free resources before you can launch another\n(see\
          \ Instance tab to Terminate). If you need more resources see the allocation\n\
          tab to apply for an increase. \n If the above doesn't apply to you, alternatively,\
          \ you can send an email to the\nCloud Help Desk. Please find how to lodge\
          \ a support ticket from\nNectar Support. "

  html: "<p>This guide describes launching a running instance (virtual machine) with\
    \ SSH login\nenabled.</p>\n<h2>Preparation</h2>\n<p>You need to create a public/private\
    \ key pair before you can use SSH to login to \nthe newly created instance. The\
    \ public key will be inserted into the instance and\nthe private key is used on\
    \ your desktop/laptop.</p>\n<h3>Windows User</h3>\n<p>Use PuTTYgen key generator\
    \ to generate the required key pair.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Download PuTTYgen (<code>puttygen.exe</code>)\
    \ from <a href=\"http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html\"\
    >PuTTYgen download page</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Launch the PuTTYgen application\
    \ by double clicking the <code>puttygen.exe</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The default\
    \ settings are fine for this case, click the 'Generate' button</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\
    <p>Save your public key by clicking 'Save public key' button. You should give\
    \ a\n name that will help identify the key in the future</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Save\
    \ your private key by clicking 'Save private key' button. You should give\n a\
    \ sensible name for future reference. The passphrase can provide additional\n\
    \ security, though can be left empty.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Linux/Mac User</h3>\n\
    <p>Type <code>ssh-keygen</code> in the terminal and enter. This generates a public\
    \ key\n(<code>id_rsa.pub</code>) and a private key (<code>id_rsa</code>). By default,\
    \ the two keys are\nlocated in <code>~/.ssh</code></p>\n<h3>Import Public Key</h3>\n\
    <p>The public key generated by Windows/Linux/Mac are required to be imported into\n\
    the Nectar Cloud dashboard before use.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Log into the <a href=\"\
    https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au\">Cloud Dashboard</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Go\
    \ to the Access and Security tab and then to the Keypairs page</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\
    <p>Click 'Import Key Pair' button</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Type in a keypair name\
    \ and paste the contents of the public key. For Windows\n users, open PuTTYgen\
    \ and click 'Load' button to load the related private key and\n copy/paste the\
    \ public key contents. For Linux/Mac user, type\n cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub and copy/paste\
    \ the public key contents from the terminal\n output</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Nectar\
    \ Cloud Dashboard</h3>\n<p>Key pairs can also be created directly through the\
    \ Nectar Cloud Dashboard.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Login to the <a href=\"https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au\"\
    >Cloud Dashboard</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Go to the Access and Security tab and\
    \ then to the Keypairs page</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click the 'Create Key Pair' button</p>\n\
    </li>\n<li>\n<p>Type in a keypair name in the popup window and click the 'Create\
    \ Key Pair'\n button</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Save the private key into a directory</p>\n\
    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Notes: If you are running a Windows machine the SSH private key\
    \ will need to be\nconverted (use PuTTYgen for converting keys)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n\
    <p>Open PuTTYgen</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click 'Load' button to load the private\
    \ key generated by the Cloud Dashboard</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click 'Export OpenSSH\
    \ key' from 'Conversions' menu</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Type a private key name and\
    \ save</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Select an Image</h2>\n<p>You need to select an image\
    \ to be used for your instance. The image defines what\noperating system the instance\
    \ uses and thus you need to select an image based on\nyour needs. Nectar Cloud\
    \ offers a list of official images and for\nsimplicity, these images are recommended.\
    \ You can find a complete list of\nofficial images from <a href=\"https://wiki.rc.nectar.org.au/wiki/Image_Catalog\"\
    >Nectar image catalog</a>. You can also find all\navailable images from the <a\
    \ href=\"https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au\">Cloud Dashboard</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n\
    <li>\n<p>Login to the <a href=\"https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au\">Cloud Dashboard</a></p>\n\
    </li>\n<li>\n<p>Go to the Dashboard Images tab</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For advanced\
    \ users, you can also create your own images. Please refer to\nthe <a href=\"\
    http://docs.openstack.org/image-guide/content/ch_creating_images_manually.html\"\
    >openstack documentation</a> for more details.</p>\n<h2>Configure Instance</h2>\n\
    <p>Before you can launch an instance, you need to configure the below options:</p>\n\
    <h3>Details</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Instance Name: the name used by the dashboard\
    \ to identify the instance</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Flavour: the resources available\
    \ for the instance. It specifies the number of\n VCPUs, size of root disk, size\
    \ of ephemeral disk and size of RAM.\n Your allocated flavour or lesser configurations\
    \ can be selected (the\n default is m2.tiny; a 1 VCPU machine)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\
    <p>Instance Count: number of instance to launch (the default is 1)</p>\n</li>\n\
    <li>\n<p>Instance Boot Source: the media used to boot the instance. You can boot\
    \ from\n image, snapshot and volume (the default is boot from image)</p>\n</li>\n\
    <li>\n<p>Boot from image: Boot instance using an image</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Boot\
    \ from snapshot: Boot instance using a snapshot</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Boot from\
    \ volume: Boot instance from volume storage</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Image Name: the\
    \ name of an Image. This option is used when the Instance Boot\n Source is 'Boot\
    \ from image'</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Access &amp; Security</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n\
    <p>Key Pair: the public/private keys used to log into the instance. See above\
    \ to\n see how to create them. This can't be added or changed after the instance\
    \ is\n created.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Security Groups: add network access to your\
    \ instances. This determines what\n services can be accessed on the instance.\
    \ You must select 'SSH' Security Groups\n to allow you to login via SSH. If 'SSH'\
    \ Security Groups is not available, you\n can create it by going to Access &amp;\
    \ Security tab on the right hand side of the\n Cloud Dashboard. The default Security\
    \ Group (no network access at first) is\n pre-selected</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To\
    \ create a Security Group:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Login to the <a href=\"https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au\"\
    >Cloud Dashboard</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Go to the Access &amp; Security tab</p>\n\
    </li>\n<li>\n<p>Click 'Create Security Group' button</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Give\
    \ a name for the Security Group</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Give a meaningful description\
    \ for the Security Group</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click 'Create Security Group' button</p>\n\
    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>The newly created Security Group has no rules added (no network\
    \ access defined).\nTo add rules to a Security Group:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Go to\
    \ the Access &amp; Security tab</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tick to select the Security\
    \ Group to add rules</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click 'Manage Rules' button</p>\n</li>\n\
    <li>\n<p>Click 'Add Rule' button</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Select what type of Rule\
    \ you want to create</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Select from 'Open Port' the 'Port' option\
    \ to open one single port, or 'Port Range'\n to open a range of ports</p>\n</li>\n\
    <li>\n<p>The 'Remote' option specifies the source of the traffic to be allowed\
    \ via this\n rule. You may do so either in the form of an IP address block (CIDR)\
    \ or via a\n source group (Security Group).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click 'Add' button</p>\n\
    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can also click 'Delete Rule' button to delete a rule</p>\n\
    <h3>Availability Zone</h3>\n<p>Select the Availability Zone for your instance.\
    \ The Availability Zone is the\nlocation for your instance. By default, the system\

    \ button to select from a\ncomplete list of available Availability Zones</p>\n\
    <h3>Post-Creation</h3>\n<p>You can execute a customization script after you launch\
    \ your instance. You can\ndo any initialization and customization to your instance\
    \ by using this and it\nis executed only once at the first boot of your instance.\
    \ You can copy/paste\nyour script by selecting 'Direct Input' or you can upload\
    \ a script file. The\nscript can be a shell script or Cloud-init script.</p>\n\
    <h3>Advanced Options</h3>\n<p>You can choose whether you automaticly or manually\
    \ create the disk partition.\nIn most cases, you shouldn't change the default.</p>\n\
    <p>Notes: The above configuration options can be set in the 'Launch Instance'\
    \ popup\nwindow. To launch the popup window, you can go to the Instances tab and\n\
    click 'Launch Instance' button.</p>\n<p>To get more information about the terms\

          \ Access to the Nectar\nCloud is enabled by the Australian Access Federation\
          \ (AAF). \n AAF Authentication \n Your AAF credentials are the same as your\
          \ institutional username and password.\nTo check that your organisation\
          \ is a member of the AAF check the\ncomplete AAF member list here. \n If\
          \ your institution is not a member of the AAF, talk to your local IT team\n\
          to arrange access. \n Logging in \n Once you have obtained your AAF credentials,\
          \ you can follow these steps to\nlogin to NeCTAR Dashboard: \n \n \n Click\
          \ 'log in' \n \n \n In dropdown list, select the name of your research institution\
          \ \n \n \n Click 'Select' \n \n \n Wait until the selected institutional\
          \ login page appears \n \n \n Type in your username and password \n \n \n\
          \ Click 'Continue' \n \n \n If you have any issues contact the Nectar help\
          \ team. \n API Credentials \n The first time you login to the dashboard\
          \ a NeCTAR Cloud account is created\nfor you. You will need this account\
          \ if you want to access the Cloud outside of\nthe dashboard through the\
          \ API. The API is a programming interface providing\nmore flexibility of\
          \ utilising the power of the cloud. \n There are two types of API credentials\
          \ and which one you use will depend on\nthe API client you use. The below\
          \ section only works for Linux/Unix users. \n Openstack API \n It requires\
          \ 6 variables to be set in order to authenticate against\nthe NeCTAR Cloud:\
          \ \n \n \n OS_AUTH_URL: authentication URL \n \n \n OS_TENANT_ID: tenant\
          \ id \n \n \n OS_TENANT_NAME: tenant name (optional) \n \n \n OS_USERNAME:\
          \ username \n \n \n OS_PASSWORD: password \n \n \n OS_REGION_NAME:  location\
          \ of your configuration (optional) \n \n \n You can set these variables\
          \ through\nenvironment variables. For example: \n OS_AUTH_URL: URL \n OS_TENANT_NAME=my_science_project\
          \ \n OS_USERNAME=clouduser@example.edu.au \n OS_PASSWORD=XXXXXX \n If you\
          \ are a member of multiple projects (tenants) you may also want to set:\n\
          OS_NO_CACHE=True \n The Dashboard provides a convenient way to help you\
          \ setting up these variables\nvia a shell script file. You can follow the\
          \ below steps to obtain it: \n \n \n Go To Dashboard \n \n \n Login to dashboard\
          \ via AAF Credentials \n \n \n Click 'Access & Security' \n \n \n Click\
          \ 'API Access' tap \n \n \n Click 'Download OpenStack RC File' \n \n \n\
          \ Save the shell script file in your local computer/laptop \n \n \n The\
          \ password is not automatically set for you for security reason. You can\
          \ also\nobtain the API password from NeCTAR cloud. Please follow the below\
          \ steps to get\nthe password: \n \n \n Go To Dashboard \n \n \n Login to\
          \ dashboard via AAF Credentials \n \n \n On the right top of the page, click\
          \ drop down list containing your email\n address \n \n \n Click 'Settings'\
          \ \n \n \n Click 'Reset Password' button \n \n \n The copy/paste the password\
          \ appeared on the screen to a text file, then save\n the text file in your\
          \ local computer/laptop. \n \n \n To execute the shell script file, type\
          \ source filename, then enter the password\nyou obtained earlier from NeCTAR\
          \ dashboard. \n Now, you are authenticated and please refer to\nrelevant\
          \ API document to see how to interact with the\nNeCTAR Cloud. \n EC2 API\
          \ \n There are 2 variables needed when using EC2 API clients: \n \n \n EC2_ACCESS_KEY:\
          \ username \n \n \n EC2_SECRET_KEY: password \n \n \n You can obtain these\
          \ 2 variables via the NeTCAR Dashboard: \n \n \n Go To Dashboard \n \n \n\

          \ copy and delete\ninstances. They have an operating system (you select\
          \ it from a list), network\naccess (a real IP address & you specify any\
          \ access), and hard disk storage.\nWith no hardware to maintain you can\
          \ copy (Snapshot) and customise new\nmachines rapidly. \n Tools \n The Nectar\
          \ Cloud Dashboard \n The Dashboard provides a web interface to get all the\
          \ basic\nResearch Cloud related jobs done. \n Use the dashboard: \n \n for\
          \ basic Cloud operations: (launching, duplicating & terminating ) instances\
          \ \n to get [Credentials] you can use with other [API clients] \n to make\
          \ an allocation request for a larger ongoing share of Research Cloud Resources.\
          \ \n \n More about instances \n If you are familiar with connecting to remote\
          \ machines already\nthe same tools and techniques apply when connecting\
          \ to running\ninstances. Your instance has a public IP address and, if\n\
          configured, can be reached and controlled with any remote\naccess tools\
          \ you wish to use. Example SSH. \n More information about launching and\
          \ managing instances is here \n Images \n Instances originate from Images\
          \ and can be a plain \"off the\nshelf\" Operating System or include software\
          \ packages and\nconfig changes to suit a particular purpose (eg Webserving).\n\
          There are publicly available images in the cloud ready for\nyou to use.\
          \ \n To suit your specific purposes an instance may need some\ncustomisation,\
          \ configuration changes or software installation.\nIts a good idea to make\
          \ a copy of the instance if you wish to\nre-use its current state as a starting\
          \ point for new instances.\nIf you are experimenting and making changes,\
          \ a copy allows you\nto return to the copied state and dispose of the experiment\n\
          without having to undo/redo configuration changes. \n You can create an\
          \ Image from scratch, but usually its easier\nto customise & copy a running\
          \ instance that is close\nto what you need. \n Copies of instances are called\
          \ Snapshots and can be used\nlike other Images to start new instances. Making\
          \ a Snapshot\nis simple: \n \n Go to the Dashboard \"Instances\" tab \n\
          \ Click \"Create Snapshot\" for the running instance you wish to copy. \n\
          \ \n Keypairs \n Key Pairs enable you to communicate with your instance\
          \ via\nSSH. When launching an instance you specify an existing key\npair.\
          \ The public key is injected into the running\ninstance's authorized_keys\
          \ file. \n You can manage your keypairs through the Dashboard or via\nthe\
          \ nova CLI client. \n In the dashboard under the Access & Security tab you\
          \ can\nmanage your keys. You have the option of: \n \n Importing an existing\
          \ SSH key you own \n Creating a new SSH Key \n \n Important: Keypairs can\
          \ only be specified on instance\ncreation, if you don't specify a keypair\
          \ on creation you will\nnot be able to add it later. \n Security groups\
          \ \n Incoming network access to your machines is usually required.\nSecurity\
          \ Groups are how to add network access. If you can't\nreach your instance\
          \ by SSH to login or by browser if it\nruns a Webserver additional Security\
          \ Group settings could be\nneeded. \n [Add link to more info] \n Storage\
          \ in the cloud \n The NeCTAR Research Cloud provides instances for research\n\
          use. While resources like processing cores, RAM and the\namount of storage\
          \ you get are dedicated to a particular\ninstance, other resources like\
          \ the network and the underlying\nstorage system are shared among instances.\
          \ Furthermore, not\nall storage is created equal, and Research Cloud users\n\
          have a few different types of storage available which differ\naccording\
          \ to performance, persistence and data safety. \n To find out which storage\
          \ option is right for you. We need\nto write the documentation for it. [LINK] "

          <h3>More about instances</h3>

          <p>If you are familiar with connecting to remote machines already

          the same tools and techniques apply when connecting to running

          instances. Your instance has a public IP address and, if

          configured, can be reached and controlled with any remote

          access tools you wish to use. Example SSH.</p>

          <p>More information about launching and managing instances is here</p>

          <h3>Images</h3>

          <p>Instances originate from Images and can be a plain "off the

          shelf" Operating System or include software packages and

          config changes to suit a particular purpose (eg Webserving).

          There are publicly available images in the cloud ready for

          you to use.</p>

          <p>To suit your specific purposes an instance may need some

          customisation, configuration changes or software installation.

          Its a good idea to make a copy of the instance if you wish to

          re-use its current state as a starting point for new instances.

          If you are experimenting and making changes, a copy allows you

          to return to the copied state and dispose of the experiment

          without having to undo/redo configuration changes.</p>

          <p>You can create an Image from scratch, but usually its easier

          to customise &amp; copy a running instance that is close

          to what you need.</p>

          <p>Copies of instances are called Snapshots and can be used

          like other Images to start new instances. Making a Snapshot

          is simple:</p>

          <ol>

          <li>Go to the Dashboard "Instances" tab</li>

          <li>Click "Create Snapshot" for the running instance you wish to copy.</li>

          </ol>

          <h2>Keypairs</h2>

          <p>Key Pairs enable you to communicate with your instance via

          SSH. When launching an instance you specify an existing key

          pair. The public key is injected into the running

          instance''s authorized_keys file.</p>

          <p>You can manage your keypairs through the Dashboard or via

          the nova CLI client.</p>

          <p>In the dashboard under the Access &amp; Security tab you can

          manage your keys. You have the option of:</p>

          <ul>

          <li>Importing an existing SSH key you own</li>

          <li>Creating a new SSH Key</li>

          </ul>

          <p><strong>Important:</strong> Keypairs can only be specified on instance

          creation, if you don''t specify a keypair on creation you will

          not be able to add it later.</p>

          <h2>Security groups</h2>

          <p>Incoming network access to your machines is usually required.

          Security Groups are how to add network access. If you can''t

          reach your instance by SSH to login or by browser if it

          runs a Webserver additional Security Group settings could be

          needed.</p>

          <p>[Add link to more info]</p>

          <h2>Storage in the cloud</h2>

          <p>The NeCTAR Research Cloud provides instances for research

          use. While resources like processing cores, RAM and the

          amount of storage you get are dedicated to a particular

          instance, other resources like the network and the underlying

          storage system are shared among instances. Furthermore, not

          all storage is created equal, and Research Cloud users

          have a few different types of storage available which differ

          according to performance, persistence and data safety.</p>

          <p>To find out which storage option is right for you. We need

          to write the documentation for it. [LINK]</p>'

    <h2>What is the Nectar Cloud</h2>

    <p><a href="http://nectar.org.au/">Nectar</a> (National eResearch Collaboration
    Tools and Resources) is an Australian Government project funded to build new infrastructure
    specifically for the needs of Australian researchers.  The Nectar Cloud provides
    supported computing infrastructure, giving researchers access to computing resources
    without the need to purchase or host their own hardware.<br>

    All Australian researchers have access to the Nectar Cloud via the <a href="http://support.rc.nectar.org.au/node/111">AAF</a>.</p>

    <p>To access the cloud all users must first login through the

    Nectar Cloud dashboard:

    <a href="https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au/">https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au/</a></p>

    <h2>Instances</h2>

    <p>Instances running inside the Research Cloud are just like real-life machines
    but

    in a remote location. The Research Cloud is used to start, copy and delete

    instances. They have an operating system (you select it from a list), network

    access (a real IP address &amp; you specify any access), and hard disk storage.

    With no hardware to maintain you can copy (Snapshot) and customise new

    machines rapidly.</p>

    <h2>Tools</h2>

    <h3>The Nectar Cloud Dashboard</h3>

    <p>The Dashboard provides a web interface to get all the basic

    Research Cloud related jobs done.</p>

    <p>Use the dashboard:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>for basic Cloud operations: (launching, duplicating &amp; terminating ) instances</li>

    <li>to get [Credentials] you can use with other [API clients]</li>

    <li>to make an allocation request for a larger ongoing share of Research Cloud
    Resources.</li>

    that other users can make use of the resources.</p>

    <p>Currently, there is no formal Nectar mechanism to discourage wasteful use of

    your allocation, but this is likely to change.</p>

    <h2>What should I do when I am finished with an instance</h2>

    <p>When you are finished with an Instance, you should terminate it.  Leaving an

    instance running, or in "paused" or "suspended" or "shutdown" states is tying

    down resources that other people could be using.</p>

    <p>Note that terminating an instance destroys its primary and ephemeral file

    systems.  If you want to save the primary file system (so that you can launch
    a

    new instance), snapshot the instance before you terminate it.</p>'

          \ persistence and data safety. \n On Virtual Machine Storage \n Each virtual\
          \ machine in the NeCTAR Cloud comes with a certain amount of built-in\n\
          storage and these storages are appeared as two separated hard disks\n(Root\
          \ Disk and Ephemeral Disk). These storage run off robust\nenterprise-grade\
          \ storage hardware on the back. However, both storage are not\nsuitable\
          \ for long-term persistent data as data will be lost after termination or\n\
          rebuilt of virtual machine. \n Root Disk \n This storage is used for operating\
          \ system of the virtual machine to boot it\ninto a functional state. It\
          \ has a limited 10GB in size, which is same for every\nstandard size of\
          \ virtual machine (Small, Medium, Large, Extra Large and\nExtra Extra Large).\
          \ The size various for non standard virtual machines such as\ntiny, which\
          \ only has 5GB root storage. \n Data stored on the root storage are persistent\
          \ until the termination or rebuilt\nof the virtual machine and are copied\
          \ during the snapshot. That means, if you\nreboot your virtual machine,\

          \ need to be taken as it should not be filled in full. The name of\nthis\
          \ disk as seen from the virtual machine is usually /dev/vda. \n Ephemeral\

          \ as you wish. It varies\nin size according to the size of virtual machine\
          \ (from 0GB to 480GB). For every\nCPU an standard virtual machine will get\
          \ 30GB of additional ephemeral storage.\nIt various in size for non-standard\
          \ virtual machine. The name of this device as\nseen from the instance is\
          \ usually /dev/vdb and some operating systems will\nautomatically format\
          \ and mount the ephemeral disk. For example, Ubuntu creates\nan ext3 partition\
          \ and mounts it at /mnt. For operating system don't do it\nautomatically,\
          \ you can format it by executing mkfs.ext4 /dev/vdb in command line\nand\
          \ mount it by executing mount /dev/vdb /mnt. You also need to have root\n\
          permission to do that. \n Data stored on ephemeral disk are only persistent\
          \ until the termination or\nrebuilt of virtual machine, which are same as\
          \ the root disk. The only difference\nis data on ephemeral disk are not\
          \ copied when taking an snapshot of virtual\nmachine, which means you cannot\
          \ use snapshot to save data stored on ephemeral\ndisk. \n Backup of Ephemeral\
          \ Disk \n Data on the ephemeral disk does not get saved in a snapshot, and\
          \ requires other\ntechniques to make a backup. Other forms of storage can\
          \ be used such as the\nObject Store and Volume Storage within the Research\
          \ Cloud or external locations. \n Persistent Volume Storage \n Persistent\
          \ volume storage can live outside your virtual machine. It is appears\n\
          as block storage which can be attached then accessed and even booted from.\
          \ This\nis a storage volume that you can attach to from within your virtual\
          \ machine,\nrea and write data, detach it, and make it available to another\
          \ virtual machine.\nYour data on a persistent volume is retained even when\
          \ you terminate your\nvirtual machine. Persistent Volumes offer a snapshot\
          \ feature which can be used\nto make convenient backups (uses some of your\
          \ overall Persistent Volume quota). \n NOTE: Persistent Volumes are local\
          \ services and only virtual machines in the\navailability zone where the\
          \ persistent Volume has been created can access it. \n How to Get Persistent\
          \ Volume Storage \n By default, there are no persistent volume storage available\
          \ to your project.\nYou need to make an allocation request to apply for\
          \ how many persistent volume\nstorage you want to have for your project.\
          \ Follow the below steps to make a\nrequest: \n \n \n Login to NeCTAR Cloud\
          \ Dashboard \n \n \n Go to Allocations and you can either click 'New Request'\
          \ to make a new request\n or 'My Requests' to amend an existing request\
          \ \n \n \n Under section 'Storage Quota', you select 'Resource' as volume,\
          \ select the\n Zone you want the storage to be and enter the GB in the 'Requested\
          \ Quota'. \n \n \n Click 'Submit' button \n \n \n Note:\nIt would take a\
          \ while before your request get approved. \n Create a persistent volume\
          \ storage \n Once your request has been approved, your project should have\
          \ volume storage\navailable. You need to create volume storage in NeCTAR\
          \ Cloud Dashboard first\nbefore you can use it. \n \n \n Login to NeCTAR\
          \ Cloud Dashboard \n \n \n Go to 'Volumes' \n \n \n Click 'Create Volume'\
          \ button \n \n \n Give a Volume Name and meaningful description \n \n \n\
          \ Select a volume source, this is how volume get built. You can select\n\
          \ 'No source empty volume' to create new empty volume. You can select 'image'\
          \ to\n build a volume from a image or 'Volume' to build a volume from existing\
          \ volume \n \n \n Give size to volume in GB \n \n \n Give a availability\
          \ zone \n \n \n Click 'Create Volume' button \n \n \n Attach a persistent\
          \ volume storage \n you can attach the volume created earlier to a running\
          \ virtual machine. See the\nbelow instruction: \n \n \n Login to NeCTAR\
          \ Cloud Dashboard \n \n \n Go to 'Volumes' \n \n \n Click the action list\

          \ \n Click 'Attach Volume' button \n \n \n Use Persistent Volume Storage\
          \ in Virtual Machine \n For a standard flavor virtual machine the persistent\
          \ volume will be attached\nas /dev/vdc. \n A new volume may not have a file\
          \ system (depending on how it was created) and\nyou need to create one before\
          \ mounting. \n The exact mount command syntax is dependent on the virtual\
          \ machine' operating\nsystem and the type of file system you require. \n\
          \ You can use below command to create file system on the new volume:\nsudo\
          \ mkfs.ext4 /dev/vdc \n WARNING: This can cause data loss if a file system\
          \ already exists on the target\nVolume. \n You can use below command to\
          \ mount the volume to /mnt\nsudo mount /dev/vdc /mnt -t auto \n Notes:\n\
          Volumes must be detached before deletion. \n Object Storage \n The NeCTAR\
          \ Cloud Object Storage is not a traditional file system, but rather a\n\
          distributed storage system for static data such as virtual machine images,\n\
          photo storage, email storage, backups and archives. Having no central \"\
          brain\" or\nmaster point of control provides greater scalability, redundancy\
          \ and durability.\nWhen you put a file in the NeCTAR Cloud Object Store,\
          \ 3 copies of your data are\ndistributed to different hardware for extra\
          \ data safety and performance. \n Think about that dataset comprised of\
          \ 2GB files that you read in and analyse\nmany times, but in general it\
          \ doesn't change. Or the images you want to use on\nthe cloud. Those are\
          \ a couple examples of what's perfect for Object Storage.\nObjects are written\
          \ to multiple hardware devices in the data center to ensure\nintegrity,\
          \ and great performance! \n In general, the object store is great for data\
          \ you write once and read many\ntimes, but not suitable for applications\
          \ like databases. It's the safest place\nto put your data on the NeCTAR\
          \ Research Cloud as multiple redundant copies of\nyour data are made, and\
          \ it has great performance. You can access the objec\nstore from anywhere\
          \ on the Internet, and data from Object Storage can be\ntransferred to and\
          \ from your virtual machine with a variety of http-capable\ntools. \n Object\
          \ Storage is completely decoupled from your virtual machine, so even if\
          \ you\nreboot, delete or crash your virtual machine, your Object Storage\
          \ files will\nremain safe (unless you remove them yourself). Object Storage\
          \ persists\nindependently from the life of an instance. \n Swift \n Swift\
          \ is the component that provides object storage for OpenStack. With your\n\
          credentials and via a URL you can request Swift to reserve & create storage\n\
          (called containers or buckets). Files (known as objects when stored in Swift)\n\
          can then be uploaded and accessed similarly by your running virtual machines.\
          \ \n The NeCTAR implementation of Swift is geodistributed across Nodes of\
          \ the NeCTAR\nCloud so that availability is not rely on any one data center\
          \ or network\ninfrastructure. Each collection of Swift nodes/hardware is\
          \ known as a region,\nwhich may or may not include a Swift proxy server\
          \ (the Internet facing and\nserving component of Swift). With some Swift\
          \ clients/APIs users can explicitly\nchose which proxy to connect to, this\
          \ might be useful e.g. for speeding up\nwrites to object storage by choosing\
          \ the nearest proxy. Due to NeCTAR's Swift\nhaving multiple regions (some\
          \ of which are Node private) some clients/APIs\nrequire explicit configuration\
          \ of a default region, which should be \"Melbourne\"\nfor most users. "

    \ hardware on the back. However, both storage are not\nsuitable for long-term\
    \ persistent data as data will be lost after termination or\nrebuilt of virtual\
    \ machine.</p>\n<h3>Root Disk</h3>\n<p>This storage is used for operating system\
    \ of the virtual machine to boot it\ninto a functional state. It has a limited\
    \ 10GB in size, which is same for every\nstandard size of virtual machine (Small,\
    \ Medium, Large, Extra Large and\nExtra Extra Large). The size various for non\
    \ standard virtual machines such as\ntiny, which only has 5GB root storage.</p>\n\
    <p>Data stored on the root storage are persistent until the termination or rebuilt\n\
    of the virtual machine and are copied during the snapshot. That means, if you\n\
    reboot your virtual machine, the data remains in tact and when you take a\npoint-in-time\
    \ snapshot of your virtual machine, the entire root storage is\ncopied. As the\
    \ root storage comes with fixed size and are used by the operation\nsystem, caution\
    \ need to be taken as it should not be filled in full. The name of\nthis disk\
    \ as seen from the virtual machine is usually /dev/vda.</p>\n<h3>Ephemeral Disk</h3>\n\
    <p>This storage appears as a second hard disk in your virtual machine and are\
    \ raw\nand unformatted block device, that you can format and use as you wish.\
    \ It varies\nin size according to the size of virtual machine (from 0GB to 480GB).\
    \ For every\nCPU an standard virtual machine will get 30GB of additional ephemeral\
    \ storage.\nIt various in size for non-standard virtual machine. The name of this\
    \ device as\nseen from the instance is usually /dev/vdb and some operating systems\
    \ will\nautomatically format and mount the ephemeral disk. For example, Ubuntu\
    \ creates\nan ext3 partition and mounts it at /mnt. For operating system don't\
    \ do it\nautomatically, you can format it by executing mkfs.ext4 /dev/vdb in command\
    \ line\nand mount it by executing mount /dev/vdb /mnt. You also need to have root\n\
    permission to do that.</p>\n<p>Data stored on ephemeral disk are only persistent\
    \ until the termination or\nrebuilt of virtual machine, which are same as the\
    \ root disk. The only difference\nis data on ephemeral disk are not copied when\
    \ taking an snapshot of virtual\nmachine, which means you cannot use snapshot\
    \ to save data stored on ephemeral\ndisk.</p>\n<h4>Backup of Ephemeral Disk</h4>\n\
    <p>Data on the ephemeral disk does not get saved in a snapshot, and requires other\n\
    techniques to make a backup. Other forms of storage can be used such as the\n\
    Object Store and Volume Storage within the Research Cloud or external locations.</p>\n\
    <h2>Persistent Volume Storage</h2>\n<p>Persistent volume storage can live outside\
    \ your virtual machine. It is appears\nas block storage which can be attached\
    \ then accessed and even booted from. This\nis a storage volume that you can attach\
    \ to from within your virtual machine,\nrea and write data, detach it, and make\
    \ it available to another virtual machine.\nYour data on a persistent volume is\
    \ retained even when you terminate your\nvirtual machine. Persistent Volumes offer\
    \ a snapshot feature which can be used\nto make convenient backups (uses some\
    \ of your overall Persistent Volume quota).</p>\n<p>NOTE: Persistent Volumes are\
    \ local services and only virtual machines in the\navailability zone where the\
    \ persistent Volume has been created can access it.</p>\n<h3>How to Get Persistent\
    \ Volume Storage</h3>\n<p>By default, there are no persistent volume storage available\
    \ to your project.\nYou need to make an allocation request to apply for how many\
    \ persistent volume\nstorage you want to have for your project. Follow the below\
    \ steps to make a\nrequest:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Login to NeCTAR Cloud <a href=\"\
    https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au\">Dashboard</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Go to\
    \ Allocations and you can either click 'New Request' to make a new request\n or\
    \ 'My Requests' to amend an existing request</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Under section\
    \ 'Storage Quota', you select 'Resource' as volume, select the\n Zone you want\
    \ the storage to be and enter the GB in the 'Requested Quota'.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\
    <p>Click 'Submit' button</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note:\nIt would take a while before\
    \ your request get approved.</p>\n<h3>Create a persistent volume storage</h3>\n\
    <p>Once your request has been approved, your project should have volume storage\n\
    available. You need to create volume storage in NeCTAR Cloud Dashboard first\n\
    before you can use it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Login to NeCTAR Cloud <a href=\"https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au\"\
    >Dashboard</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Go to 'Volumes'</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click\
    \ 'Create Volume' button</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Give a Volume Name and meaningful\
    \ description</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Select a volume source, this is how volume\
    \ get built. You can select\n 'No source empty volume' to create new empty volume.\
    \ You can select 'image' to\n build a volume from a image or 'Volume' to build\
    \ a volume from existing volume</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Give size to volume in GB</p>\n\
    </li>\n<li>\n<p>Give a availability zone</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click 'Create Volume'\
    \ button</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Attach a persistent volume storage</h3>\n<p>you\
    \ can attach the volume created earlier to a running virtual machine. See the\n\
    below instruction:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Login to NeCTAR Cloud <a href=\"https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au\"\
    >Dashboard</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Go to 'Volumes'</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click\
    \ the action list of volume</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click 'Edit Attachment'</p>\n\
    </li>\n<li>\n<p>Click 'Attach to Instance' drop down list to select a virtual\
    \ machine to\n attach a volume</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click 'Attach Volume' button</p>\n\
    </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Use Persistent Volume Storage in Virtual Machine</h3>\n<p>For\
    \ a standard flavor virtual machine the persistent volume will be attached\nas\
    \ /dev/vdc.</p>\n<p>A new volume may not have a file system (depending on how\
    \ it was created) and\nyou need to create one before mounting.</p>\n<p>The exact\
    \ mount command syntax is dependent on the virtual machine' operating\nsystem\
    \ and the type of file system you require.</p>\n<p>You can use below command to\
    \ create file system on the new volume:\nsudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/vdc</p>\n<p>WARNING:\
    \ This can cause data loss if a file system already exists on the target\nVolume.</p>\n\
    <p>You can use below command to mount the volume to /mnt\nsudo mount /dev/vdc\
    \ /mnt -t auto</p>\n<p>Notes:\nVolumes must be detached before deletion.</p>\n\
    <h2>Object Storage</h2>\n<p>The NeCTAR Cloud Object Storage is not a traditional\
    \ file system, but rather a\ndistributed storage system for static data such as\
    \ virtual machine images,\nphoto storage, email storage, backups and archives.\
    \ Having no central \"brain\" or\nmaster point of control provides greater scalability,\
    \ redundancy and durability.\nWhen you put a file in the NeCTAR Cloud Object Store,\
    \ 3 copies of your data are\ndistributed to different hardware for extra data\
    \ safety and performance.</p>\n<p>Think about that dataset comprised of 2GB files\
    \ that you read in and analyse\nmany times, but in general it doesn't change.\
    \ Or the images you want to use on\nthe cloud. Those are a couple examples of\
    \ what's perfect for Object Storage.\nObjects are written to multiple hardware\
    \ devices in the data center to ensure\nintegrity, and great performance!</p>\n\
    <p>In general, the object store is great for data you write once and read many\n\
    times, but not suitable for applications like databases. It's the safest place\n\
    to put your data on the NeCTAR Research Cloud as multiple redundant copies of\n\
    your data are made, and it has great performance. You can access the objec\nstore\
    \ from anywhere on the Internet, and data from Object Storage can be\ntransferred\
    \ to and from your virtual machine with a variety of http-capable\ntools.</p>\n\
    <p>Object Storage is completely decoupled from your virtual machine, so even if\
    \ you\nreboot, delete or crash your virtual machine, your Object Storage files\
    \ will\nremain safe (unless you remove them yourself). Object Storage persists\n\
    independently from the life of an instance.</p>\n<h3>Swift</h3>\n<p>Swift is the\
    \ component that provides object storage for OpenStack. With your\ncredentials\
    \ and via a URL you can request Swift to reserve &amp; create storage\n(called\
    \ containers or buckets). Files (known as objects when stored in Swift)\ncan then\
    \ be uploaded and accessed similarly by your running virtual machines.</p>\n<p>The\
    \ NeCTAR implementation of Swift is geodistributed across Nodes of the NeCTAR\n\
    Cloud so that availability is not rely on any one data center or network\ninfrastructure.\
    \ Each collection of Swift nodes/hardware is known as a region,\nwhich may or\
    \ may not include a Swift proxy server (the Internet facing and\nserving component\
    \ of Swift). With some Swift clients/APIs users can explicitly\nchose which proxy\
    \ to connect to, this might be useful e.g. for speeding up\nwrites to object storage\
    \ by choosing the nearest proxy. Due to NeCTAR's Swift\nhaving multiple regions\
    \ (some of which are Node private) some clients/APIs\nrequire explicit configuration\
    \ of a default region, which should be \"Melbourne\"\nfor most users.</p>"

  html: "<p>Incoming network access to your machines is usually required. Security\
    \ Groups\nare how to add network access. If you can't reach your instance by SSH\
    \ to login\nor by browser if it runs a Webserver additional Security Group settings\
    \ could\nbe needed.</p>\n<h2>Adding Network Access</h2>\n<p>The default Security\
    \ Group is empty and no incoming access is configured until\nyou add rules to\
    \ specify:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>which ports are available for connection to your instance\
    \ and...</li>\n<li>from which addresses your instance will accept inbound traffic\
    \ to the\n  open ports</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>NOTE: If you do not specify\
    \ a security group at boot the default security\ngroup will be applied</p>\n</blockquote>\n\
    <ul>\n<li>Each rule adds further access, it never cancels or overrides another\
    \ rule.</li>\n<li>Rules can have overlapping ranges and addresses.</li>\n<li>Rules\
    \ for the same ports and addresses can be added to more than one\n  Security Group</li>\n\
    </ul>\n<h2>Removing Network Access</h2>\n<p>To remove access to a port or from\
    \ an address locate all security groups with\nrules relating to that port or address,\
    \ then</p>\n<ul>\n<li>remove or edit each applicable rule, OR</li>\n<li>do not\
    \ apply those Security Groups that contain the applicable rule(s)</li>\n</ul>\n\
    <h2>Pre-Defined and Default Security Groups</h2>\n<p>For Project Trials (pt-xxxx)\
    \ there are pre-defined security groups for\nconvenience.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>SSH opens\
    \ tcp port 22 to traffic from all sources (for logging via ssh)</li>\n<li>HTTP\
    \ opens tcp ports 80 and 443 to traffic from all sources (for\n  web servers)</li>\n\
    <li>ICMP opens all ICMP traffic from all sources (etc. to allow pinging your\n\
    \  VMs IP address)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For all other shared projects that are created\
    \ after an allocation request,\nthere is only the empty 'default' security group\
    \ at first. These Projects\nshare their security groups so all changes should\
    \ be made with caution as\nthey may affect instances by other users sharing your\
    \ Project.</p>\n<h2>Managing Security Groups</h2>\n<p>Sometimes it can be convenient\
    \ to organise rules into multiple Security\nGroups,\nfor example</p>\n<ul>\n<li>apply\
    \ only some or all groups depending on a instances purpose.</li>\n<li>users experimenting\
    \ with network access can remove groups and re-apply\n  them without re-creating\
    \ rules each time</li>\n<li>testing rules on a temporary security group and test\
    \ Instance before\n  adding the same rules to Security Groups already in use.\n\
    \  rules can appear in more than one Security Group</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Applying\
    \ Security Groups</h2>\n<p>Security Groups are most conveniently applied before\
    \ Launching your\ninstance, multiple security groups can be selected.\nHowever\
    \ Security Groups can also be added or removed on running instances.</p>\n<p>Click\
    \ Launch then click the Security Groups field. The default group is\npre-selected</p>\n\
    <h2>Outgoing traffic</h2>\n<p>Outgoing traffic is not blocked on any port:  connections\
    \ that originate\nfrom your instance to the outside world, are not blocked by\
    \ Nectar\nOpenStack configuration</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Security Note</p>\n<p>Using\
    \ the Research Cloud creates a publicly accessible server (depending on\nSecurity\
    \ Groups) and therefore that machine can be exploited. All users must\nread &amp;\
    \ follow our <a href=\"../NeCTAR%20Fundamentals/Security%20Guidelines.md\">Security\
    \ Guidelines</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>"

          \ Access Group - OpenStack terminology that is a synonym for Security Group.\
          \ \n Access Rule  - An access rule allow network access to an\ninstance\
          \ from other hosts with a specified combination of protocol family (e.g.\
          \ TCP, UDP, UCMP),\nport number and address range. \n Account - OpenStack\
          \ terminology. A synonym for \"project\" and \"tenant\". \n Active Directory\
          \ (AD) - Microsoft's directory service product; essentially LDAP enhanced\
          \ with\nKerberos. Most Microsoft Windows environments will use AD to centrally\
          \ control\nauthentication. \n AMD - Advanced Micro Devices Inc. A manufacturer\
          \ of x86 and x86_64 compatible\nmicroprocessors. A direct competitor to\

          \ that is designed for\nprograms to use (As distinct from a user interface,\
          \ which is designed for\npeople to use). \n API Endpoint  - See Service\
          \ endpoint. \n apt  - The package manager used by the Debian\nfamily (Debian/Ubuntu/Mint)\
          \ of Linux distributions. \n Aspera - \"Aspera High-speed File Transfer\
          \ Software that moves the world's data at maximum\nspeed, regardless of\
          \ file size, transfer distance or network conditions\". \n Attach - An OpenStack\
          \ volume can be attached to an OpenStack instance to provide it with\nadditional\
          \ disk storage. \n Authentication - The process of establishing that an\
          \ agent (i.e. a person, or other entity) in a\ncomputer system is who they\
          \ say they are.  The simple username and password\nis the most familiar\
          \ means of authentication. \n Authorization - See Access Control. \n Availability\

          \ means by which the computer starts\nitself up after the power button is\
          \ pressed.  Ultimately booting is the process\nin which a computer goes\
          \ from having empty memory to having the operating\nsystem loaded and running.\
          \ \n Bricked - Colloquialism: describes a system that has been damaged in\
          \ a way that\npermanently locks out some or all functionality.  It's usually\
          \ the consequence\nof some kind of firmware update that fails to run properly,\
          \ or at all, meaning\nfurther remedial firmware updates are not possible.\
          \  The device is bricked when\nit can't be fixed and is effectively an expensive\
          \ square shaped \"brick\". \n C \n Canonical - Canonical Ltd. is a UK-based\
          \ privately held computer software company founded\n(and funded) by South\

          \ Collection Development Storage. \n Ceilometer - The OpenStack Ceilometer\
          \ project aims to deliver a unique point of\ncontact for billing systems\
          \ to acquire all of the measurements they need to\nestablish customer billing,\
          \ across all current OpenStack core components. \n It is also a means by\
          \ which to gather performance related metrics useful for the\ngeneral management\
          \ of the OpenStack environment in general. \n Cell - Cells are a means by\
          \ which to partition an OpenStack compute cloud into groups. \n At NeCTAR\
          \ each site runs a different configuration, as a resource cells in an\n\
          OpenStack Compute cells setup. This allows the NeCTAR nodes to do different\n\
          things such as span multiple data centers, or run off compute node storage\n\
          with a shared file system, or use on compute node storage with a non-shared\
          \ file\nsystem.  It's also a way to partition tenants and accounts. \n CentOS\
          \ - A community-based rebadging of RHEL distribution.  The result is \"\
          for free\", but with\n no support. \n Ceph - \"Ceph is a unified, distributed\
          \ storage system designed for excellent\nperformance, reliability and scalability.\"\

          \ to Puppet, but\nalso now to other such systems such as Ansible and Salt.\
          \ \n CIDR Notation - Classless Internet Domain Routing notation - a concise\
          \ notation for writing IPv4\n or IPv6 network address ranges. \n Cinder\
          \ - The OpenStack Volume Storage management service. \n The \"Cloud\" -\
          \ A network of servers used to store, manage, and process data to achieve\n\
          efficiencies of scale in completing various computational tasks. \n CloudStor\
          \ - A free cloud-based file transfer service provided by AARNET. Allows\
          \ researchers\n to send and receive large files (up to 100Gb) or the big\
          \ brother CloudStor+\nwhich is an enhanced version of CloudStor that supports\
          \ secure long-term file\nstorage. \n Cluster-as-a-service - Implementing\
          \ HPC-style compute facilities on top of cloud computing\ninfrastructure.\
          \ \n Collection - RDSI Collection - Large data collection, usually formalised\
          \ with metadata and\nmade discoverable and accessible. Stored as part of\
          \ a data storage investment\nproject called RDSI (Research Data Storage\
          \ Infrastructure). Operators of the\ninfrastructure from RDSI project are\
          \ called RDSI nodes and may still refer to\ntheir storage facilities or\
          \ collections as 'RDSI storage' or 'RDSI collection'. \n Collection VM -\
          \ RDSI collections in QRIScloud are exposed via virtual machines that run\
          \ access\nservices; e.g. scp, sftp, rsync, WebDAV & GridFTP. \n Compute\
          \ Node   - OpenStack terminology for a physical computer\nused to run virtual\
          \ machines. It will typically have multiple CPUs and shared memory, and\n\
          one or more network interfaces.  It may also have on-node disc storage.\
          \ \n Container - General Computing - a means by which to run multiple \"\
          things\" inside a given\ncomputer and have those things isolated from each\
          \ other and the computer itself.\nSimilar in concept to Virtualisation,\
          \ however not as broadly applicable because\nthe containers must be the\
          \ same operating system as the host itself. \n Copyleft - A form of software\
          \ licensing that uses Copyright Law as the legal basis for\ngranting and\
          \ enforcing license terms. \n Creative Commons - A family of licenses originally\

          \ scientific data. \n CVL - Characterization Virtual Laboratory - A NeCTAR\
          \ Virtual Laboratory project. \n D \n DaRIS (Distributed and Reflective\
          \ Informatics System) - DaRIS\nis a subject-oriented informatics framework\
          \ and capability developed\nprimarily at the University of Melbourne. It\
          \ is built with the commercial\nMediaflux data operating system. DaRIS is\
          \ mainly used to supply a repository to\nmanage bio-medical imaging data.\
          \ \n Dashboard - The NeCTAR Dashboard is the main web-based interface for\
          \ managing NeCTAR\nvirtuals. The OpenStack component service for the dashboard\
          \ is called Horizon. \n Data Centre - A place where a large collection of\
          \ shared computing equipment is housed.\nThese expensive and high security\
          \ installations are often hot and noisy and\nconsume hard drives for breakfast.\
          \ \n Data Repository - A system or service that provides systematic data\
          \ management services. More\nthan just \"a shared fileserver\". \n .deb\
          \ - The Debian standard package format. See apt. \n Debian Family - Debian,\
          \ Ubuntu, Mint and many lesser known but similar linux distributions. \n\
          \ Distribution (Linux) - Refers to a (ideally) homoginized release of the\
          \ Linux Kernel and a\ncompendium of utilities, services and applications\
          \ that are nominally modified\nand tested to run well together, then given\
          \ an odd name like \"Mandriva\" or\n\"Suse\" or \"Debian\".  May inherit\
          \ concepts, frameworks and software\nfrom other distributions with or without\
          \ attribution or other reciprocal\ncontribution.  Typically distributions\
          \ attract a zealous user base\nwho will willingly fight each other to the\
          \ bitter death over not much at all.\nSome are funded by corporations, others\
          \ by well meaning techno hippies or not\nby anyone at all. \n Distro - A\
          \ contraction of \"Distribution\". \n DMF - DMF is a\nHierarchical Storage\
          \ Management (HSM) system by SGI designed for\nthe bulk storage of data.\
          \ The basic premise is that fast storage is expensive so\nwouldn't it be\
          \ cool if we could put only the data we actually use on the fast\nstorage,\
          \ and the rest can kind of trickle through less expensive storage layers.\n\
          So the hierarchy is in fact a sandwich of storage technologies (usually\
          \ ssd,\nhdd, tape) at each of which the storage cost per gigabyte decreases.\
          \  As data\nages through the layers the usual trade off is speed, so ideally\
          \ frequently used\ndata stays on the faster storage layer.  Conversely,\
          \ data which is seldom\naccessed is often archived off to tape where the\
          \ cost per gigabyte is very low.\nMagical filesystems ideally make all of\
          \ this invisible to users and\napplications.  Usually highly expensive and\
          \ complicated, it's pretty awesome\nwhen it works. \n Docker - A tool that\
          \ helps automate the deployment of applications\ninside software containers.\
          \ \n DropBox - A company that offers cloud storage that is easily used for\
          \ file sharing\nand collaboration. \n Drupal - A popular open source website\
          \ / content management system. \n DSpace - An open source application used\

          projects. \n E \n EC2 - Amazon's \"Elastic Compute\" offering. \n EC2 Credentials\
          \ - One of the kinds of credentials you can obtain from the NeCTAR Dashboard.\n\
          It allows software written to work with the Amazon cloud to be used with\
          \ the OpenStack cloud. \n Elastic Computing  - Cloud computing resources\
          \ that can be\nadded to or removed from. \n Ephemeral Storage - Disk storage\
          \ associated with a NeCTAR instance that goes away when the\ninstance is\
          \ terminated. \n ERSA - eResearch SA runs the South Australian node of the\

          \ research publications. \n eSpaces - A web-based collaboration system for\
          \ the Australian academic community. \n F \n FAQ - A Frequently Asked Question.\
          \ A software project or an IT support organization\nwill often create an\

          \ so\nwouldn't it be cool if we could put only the data we actually use\
          \ on the fast\nstorage, and the rest can kind of trickle through less expensive\
          \ storage layers.\nSo the hierarchy is in fact a sandwich of storage technologies\
          \ (usually ssd,\nhdd, tape) at each of which the storage cost per gigabyte\
          \ decreases.  As data\nages through the layers the usual trade off is speed,\
          \ so ideally frequently used\ndata stays on the faster storage layer.  Conversely,\
          \ data which is seldom\naccessed is often archived off to tape where the\
          \ cost per gigabyte is very low.\nMagical filesystems ideally make all of\
          \ this invisible to users and\napplications.  Usually highly expensive and\

    \ and applications that are nominally modified\nand tested to run well together,\
    \ then given an odd name like \"Mandriva\" or\n\"Suse\" or \"Debian\".  May inherit\
    \ concepts, frameworks and software\nfrom other distributions with or without\

    >DMF</a> is a\nHierarchical Storage Management (HSM) system by SGI designed for\n\
    the bulk storage of data. The basic premise is that fast storage is expensive\
    \ so\nwouldn't it be cool if we could put only the data we actually use on the\
    \ fast\nstorage, and the rest can kind of trickle through less expensive storage\
    \ layers.\nSo the hierarchy is in fact a sandwich of storage technologies (usually\
    \ ssd,\nhdd, tape) at each of which the storage cost per gigabyte decreases. \
    \ As data\nages through the layers the usual trade off is speed, so ideally frequently\
    \ used\ndata stays on the faster storage layer.  Conversely, data which is seldom\n\
    accessed is often archived off to tape where the cost per gigabyte is very low.\n\
    Magical filesystems ideally make all of this invisible to users and\napplications.\
    \  Usually highly expensive and complicated, it's pretty awesome\nwhen it works.</p>\n\

          \ install python-setuptools\nsudo easy_install pip\nsudo pip install --upgrade\
          \ setuptools\nsudo pip install python-swiftclient \n Windows \n See pip\
          \ windows for instructions on installing pip for Windows. \n pip install\
          \ python-swiftclient \n Configuration \n Before you can use the python swift\
          \ client and command line API you need to be\nauthenticated to the NeCTAR\
          \ cloud. The below shows the instructions of how to\nget username/password\
          \ and get authenticated. \n \n \n Login to NeCTAR Cloud Dashboard \n \n\
          \ \n Click 'Access & Security' \n \n \n On the 'Access & Security' page,\
          \ click tab 'API Access' \n \n \n Click button \"Download OpenStack RC File\"\
          \ \n \n \n Save the file into a directory \n \n \n Click the drop down list\
          \ with your email on the right top of page, then click\n Settings \n \n\
          \ \n Click 'Reset Password' and save the password appeared on the screen\
          \ \n \n \n API normally requires 4 environment variables to be set for authentication:\
          \ \n \n auth URL \n username \n project id or name (most clients can handle\
          \ either) \n password \n \n When using the script file you downloaded from\
          \ NeCTAR Dashboard, these\nvarilabels are set by the script file and you\
          \ can see these variables\nif you open the file. Example: \n OS_AUTH_URL:\

          \ \n Authentication for Command Line API \n The below instruction assumes\
          \ you use Linux operating system. \n Once you have obtained the authentication\
          \ script and password, you can execute\nthe script suing source file-name.sh.\
          \ and type in the password you\nobtained from Dashboard. \n Authentication\
          \ for python swift API \n You can use the below sample code to get authenticated.\
          \  \n ```\nfrom swiftclient import client \n swift = client.Connection(authurl=url,\
          \ user=username, key=password,\ntenant_name=project_name, auth_version='2')\n\
          ``` \n You can get authurl, user, key and tenant_name from the above .sh\
          \ file obtained\nfrom the NeCTAR Dashboard. \n How to use \n Once the client\
          \ is authenticated, you can start to use them. See below for how\nto get\
          \ started. \n Command Line API \n you can use swift command to manage your\
          \ objects storage, you can type: \n swift --help to find out all the available\
          \ options. \n Python Swift API \n You can also use Python Swift API in your\
          \ python code to access object storage. \n See below for a sample code:\
          \ \n ``` \n from swiftclient import client \n swift = client.Connection(authurl=url,\

          \ great performance! \n In general, the object store is great for data you\
          \ write once and read many\ntimes, but not suitable for applications like\
          \ databases. It's the safest place\nto put your data on the NeCTAR Research\
          \ Cloud as multiple redundant copies of\nyour data are made, and it has\
          \ great performance. You can access the object\nstore from anywhere on the\

          traditional file systems: \n \n \n Access via API at application-level,\
          \ rather than via OS at file-system-level.\n  This means, byte-level interaction\
          \ is not possible and interaction can occur\n  via a single API end point.\
          \ \n \n \n No directory tree, object storage uses a flat structure and objects\

          \ \n \n \n Scalability. Object storage systems can scale very well when\
          \ data reaches\n  hundreds of TB and moves into the PB range and beyond.\
          \ \n \n \n Durability. Object Storage systems have mechanisms to check file\
          \ consistency,\n  and handle failed drives, bit-rot, server and cabinet\
          \ failures, etc. These\n  features allow the system to automatically replicate\
          \ data as needed to retain\n  the desired number of replicas, which results\
          \ in extremely high durability\n  and availability of data. \n \n \n Cost.\
          \ Object storage systems are designed to run on commodity hardware, it is\n\
          \  cheaper compared to block or file storage. \n \n \n Swift \n Swift is\
          \ the component that provides object storage for OpenStack. With your\n\
          credentials and via a URL you can request Swift to reserve & create storage\n\
          (called containers or buckets). Files (known as objects when stored in Swift)\n\
          can then be uploaded and accessed similarly by your running Virtual Machines.\
          \ \n The NeCTAR implementation of Swift is geodistributed across Nodes of\
          \ the\nResearch Cloud so that availability is not reliant on any one datacentre\
          \ or\nnetwork infrastructure. Each collection of Swift nodes/hardware is\
          \ known as a\nregion, which may or may not include a Swift proxy server\
          \ (the Internet facing\nand serving component of Swift). With some Swift\
          \ clients/APIs users can\nexplicitly chose which proxy to connect to, this\
          \ might be useful e.g. for\nspeeding up writes to object storage by choosing\
          \ the nearest proxy. Due to\nNeCTAR's Swift having multiple regions (some\
          \ of which are Node private) some\nclients/APIs require explicit configuration\
          \ of a default region, which should\nbe \"Melbourne\" for most users. \n\
          \ Swift does not provide encryption of the data it stores. If you have sensitive\n\

  html: "<h2>Object Storage</h2>\n<p>Object Storage is not a traditional file-system\
    \ or real-time data storage system.\nIt's designed for mostly static data that\
    \ can be retrieved, leveraged, and then\nupdated if necessary. It is independent\
    \ of a particular Virtual Machine and can\nbe updated and used without having\
    \ any Virtual Machine running. It is designed\nto be redundant and scalable.</p>\n\
    <h3>Concept</h3>\n<p>Think about that dataset comprised of 2GB files that you\
    \ read in and analyze\nmany times, but in general it doesn't change. Or the images\
    \ you want to use on\nthe cloud. Those are a couple examples of what's perfect\
    \ for Object Storage.\nObjects are written to multiple hardware devices in the\
    \ data center to ensure\nintegrity, and great performance!</p>\n<p>In general,\
    \ the object store is great for data you write once and read many\ntimes, but\
    \ not suitable for applications like databases. It's the safest place\nto put\
    \ your data on the NeCTAR Research Cloud as multiple redundant copies of\nyour\
    \ data are made, and it has great performance. You can access the object\nstore\
    \ from anywhere on the Internet, and data from Object Storage can be\ntransferred\
    \ to and from your Virtual Machine with a variety of http-capable\ntools.</p>\n\
    <p>Object Storage has the following features which are quite different from the\n\
    traditional file systems:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Access via API at application-level,\
    \ rather than via OS at file-system-level.\n  This means, byte-level interaction\
    \ is not possible and interaction can occur\n  via a single API end point.</p>\n\
    </li>\n<li>\n<p>No directory tree, object storage uses a flat structure and objects\
    \ are stored\n  in containers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Metadata lives directly with\
    \ object.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Scalability. Object storage systems can scale very\
    \ well when data reaches\n  hundreds of TB and moves into the PB range and beyond.</p>\n\
    </li>\n<li>\n<p>Durability. Object Storage systems have mechanisms to check file\
    \ consistency,\n  and handle failed drives, bit-rot, server and cabinet failures,\
    \ etc. These\n  features allow the system to automatically replicate data as needed\
    \ to retain\n  the desired number of replicas, which results in extremely high\
    \ durability\n  and availability of data.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Cost. Object storage\
    \ systems are designed to run on commodity hardware, it is\n  cheaper compared\
    \ to block or file storage.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Swift</h3>\n<p>Swift is the\
    \ component that provides object storage for OpenStack. With your\ncredentials\
    \ and via a URL you can request Swift to reserve &amp; create storage\n(called\
    \ containers or buckets). Files (known as objects when stored in Swift)\ncan then\
    \ be uploaded and accessed similarly by your running Virtual Machines.</p>\n<p>The\
    \ NeCTAR implementation of Swift is geodistributed across Nodes of the\nResearch\
    \ Cloud so that availability is not reliant on any one datacentre or\nnetwork\
    \ infrastructure. Each collection of Swift nodes/hardware is known as a\nregion,\
    \ which may or may not include a Swift proxy server (the Internet facing\nand\
    \ serving component of Swift). With some Swift clients/APIs users can\nexplicitly\
    \ chose which proxy to connect to, this might be useful e.g. for\nspeeding up\
    \ writes to object storage by choosing the nearest proxy. Due to\nNeCTAR's Swift\
    \ having multiple regions (some of which are Node private) some\nclients/APIs\
    \ require explicit configuration of a default region, which should\nbe \"Melbourne\"\
    \ for most users.</p>\n<p>Swift does not provide encryption of the data it stores.\
    \ If you have sensitive\ndata that requires encryption you must encrypt the data\
    \ files before upload.</p>"

          \ defects can be found: \n \n In the template(s) \n In the automated installation\
          \ of software \n Infrastructure problems \n Incorrect usage of resources\
          \ \n \n We believe that the command line client gives far better feedback\
          \ than\nthe dashboard. Thus preference it when developing your templates.\
          \ \n If the stack fails at start up first check that you don't have a template\n\
          formatting error. \n If you get a YAML error ('Template not in valid format'),\
          \ an online YAML parser\nsuch as the ones at YAML Lint or the Online Yaml\
          \ Parser\ncan be useful in finding the syntax error. \n To convert from\
          \ JSON to YAML, an online converter such as the one at\nConvert JSON to\
          \ YAML Online\ncan be useful in porting between the two formats. \n To debug\
          \ JSON syntax errors the following command set is useful: \n bash\ncat template.json\
          \ | python -m json.tool \n Where template.json is the name of your template.\
          \ The command simply pipes the\nfile into python, which in turn will invoke\
          \ the json module that finally will\nvalidate and pretty print the file.\
          \ \n Similarly, if you have the pyaml module installed\nyou can validate\
          \ yaml files: \n bash\ncat template.yaml | python -m pyaml \n Where template.yaml\
          \ is the name of your template. \n The form of the command in both of the\

          we have the following heuristics.</p>

          <p>There are four possible locations in which defects can be found:</p>

          <ul>

          <li>In the template(s)</li>

          <li>In the automated installation of software</li>

          <li>Infrastructure problems</li>

          <li>Incorrect usage of resources</li>

          </ul>

          <p>We believe that the command line client gives far better feedback than

          the dashboard. Thus preference it when developing your templates.</p>

          <p>If the stack fails at start up first check that you don''t have a template

          formatting error.</p>

          <p>If you get a YAML error (''Template not in valid format''), an online
          YAML parser

          such as the ones at <a href="http://yamllint.com/">YAML Lint</a> or the
          <a href="http://yaml-online-parser.appspot.com/">Online Yaml Parser</a>

          can be useful in finding the syntax error.</p>

          <p>To convert from JSON to YAML, an online converter such as the one at

          <a href="http://jsontoyaml.com/">Convert JSON to YAML Online</a>

          can be useful in porting between the two formats.</p>

          <p>To debug JSON syntax errors the following command set is useful:</p>

          <p><code>bash

          cat template.json | python -m json.tool</code></p>

          <p>Where <code>template.json</code> is the name of your template. The command
          simply pipes the

          file into python, which in turn will invoke the json module that finally
          will

          validate and pretty print the file.</p>

          <p>Similarly, if you have the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyaml/">pyaml</a>
          module installed

          you can validate yaml files:</p>

          <p><code>bash

          cat template.yaml | python -m pyaml</code></p>

          <p>Where <code>template.yaml</code> is the name of your template.</p>

          <p>The form of the command in both of the above is useful, in that you can

          verify remote files:</p>

          <p><code>bash

          curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NeCTAR-RC/heat-templates/master/json/Fedora/WordPress_2_Instances.json

          the automated installation of software.</p>

          <p>In this scenario turn to on instances log files and scripts.</p>

          <p>On the newly launched image:</p>

          <ul>

          <li>The cloud init log can be found in <code>/var/log/cloud-init.log</code>;</li>

          <li>The output of your code run by cloud init can be found in <code>/var/log/cloud-init-output.log</code>;</li>

          <li>The output of the cfn init output is found in <code>/var/log/cfn-init.log</code>;</li>

          <li>The log showing the output of users scripts run can be found in <code>/var/log/heat-provisioning.log</code>.</li>

          <p>If the stack state does reveal an error start by trying to understand
          the

          command line client error messages.</p>

          <p>If you have nested templates, you can find the ones that failed to launch
          with

          the following command:</p>

          <p><code>bash

          \ impossible to address everything. This\ndocument lists a number of security\
          \ recommendations to help ensure the safe\nrunning of your instances on\
          \ the cloud. Security is important, so please\nfollow these. \n The NecTAR\
          \ team conduct routine and random audits to determine the integrity\nof\
          \ machine images and running instances. If you have discovered a critical\n\
          security flaw, or believe your machine has been compromised, please email\n\
          security@rc.nectar.org.au, or for non-urgent security questions go to NeCTAR\n\
          support to lodge a ticket. \n Mail Servers \n If you run a mail server,\
          \ make sure it only listens on the localhost IP\naddress (127.0.0.1). For\
          \ many clients, if you don't specify an SMTP server\nwhen sending email,\
          \ it will use the recipients SMTP server automatically. This\nis probably\
          \ what you want. Some nodes (Qld) disallow this and require you to\nuse\
          \ their SMTP server for outgoing mail. \n Enable Automatic Updates \n All\
          \ operating systems have the ability to apply updates automatically, and\
          \ its\neasy to turn this on. Please do so, and ask us if you need help.\
          \ \n Upgrade your kernel \n Some updates, such as a kernel upgrade require\
          \ a reboot of the instance. Please\nschedule this into your regular maintenance.\
          \ \n No open recursive name servers \n If you are running a DNS server,\
          \ please ensure you only allow recursion from\ntrusted hosts. \n Control\
          \ or disable access to your NTP server \n If you run an NTP server, limit\
          \ which systems can access it. Disable the\n'monlist' command as this can\
          \ be used as a denial of service vector on your\nsystem. For info about\
          \ DDoS by NTP, see\nthis article on Cloudflare \n Subscribe to security\
          \ announcements for your OS \n If there is a security problem with your\
          \ Operating System, you need to find\nout as soon as possible. Find the\
          \ appropriate mailing list and keep an eye\nout for anything that requires\
          \ urgent action. As soon as new security bugs are\ndetected, you need to\
          \ execute security upgrade immediately.  \n Run a restrictive firewall \n\
          \ Your instances should be configured so they allow the minimum access required\n\
          to run their service. Please use a host-based firewall, in conjunction with\n\
          the cloud-provided firewall to manage access. \n Disable/Remove unneeded\
          \ accounts \n Keep an eye on the user accounts enabled on your system. Some\
          \ applications\ncreate default accounts which are insecure. You may also\
          \ open a temporary user\naccount to allow quick login for a task and leave\
          \ it forever. This may lead to\nsecurity issue later, and you need to regular\
          \ check and delete these user\naccounts. \n Disable SSH password login -\
          \ use keys \n With enough time and compute power it is possible for passwords\
          \ to be brute\nforce attacked. The average SSH server deals with thousands\
          \ of such attacks\nevery week, so use ssh keys. Ubuntu provides some good\

          \ a metadata service so you can download keys on boot, so\nyou don't need\
          \ to copy keys manually. This ensures that if your key is\ncompromised,\
          \ not all running instances of that image are compromised. \n Install ssh\
          \ attack banning tools \n Install a tools like fail2ban or denyhosts, which\
          \ checks log files for\nattempted breaches and then blocks malicious IP\
          \ addresses. \n Disable unneeded services \n Know what services run on your\
          \ image, and disable the unneeded ones before\nyou upload it. This reduces\
          \ the attack surface. \n Use Encrypted Communications \n Wherever possible,\
          \ use encrypted communications to avoid attacks which\nintercept data. \n\
          \ Use best-practices for logging \n Make sure that services are logging\
          \ to a secure location, that is as\ntamperproof as possible. If logging\
          \ remotely, ensure that it is done over\na secure channel so that eavesdroppers\
          \ cannot monitor what is happening on\nyour instance. \n Only open ports\
          \ for required services \n By default, virtual machines in NeCTAR has closed\
          \ all ports, so in order to make\nservices available to public, you need\
          \ to open certain ports for it. Before you\nopen a open, you need to think\
          \ carefully about what service associated with it\nand what is the intention.\
          \ Never open ports for non-service binded to it. \n Only grand sufficient\
          \ permission to user account \n When creating user account, make sure only\
          \ grand the permission sufficient for \nits use. Never grant extra permission\
          \ if it is not needed. \n Disable root access from ssh and use sudo if possible\
          \ \n Disable root user SSH login and setup user account with sudo permission\
          \ to\nperform administrator tasks. \n Use other port for SSH \n The SSH\
          \ service on the virtual machine uses port 22 by default. This port is \n\
          well-known and can attract many attackers. Use a custom ssh port other than\
          \ 22\nwill improve security. Be noted, the port number below 1024 is well\
          \ reserved and\nshouldn't be used for SSH. \n Read security guide for service\

          \ image is a big, multi-gigabtye file storage stored on storage.\nYou can\
          \ launch a instance by using different images (operating system) and you\n\
          can access it through SSH. As the instance thinks it runs in a 'real' computer\n\
          system, you can do anything just like a normal computer system. However,\
          \ there\nare still some cases that can be restricted by underline virtual\

          \ or more computing power, simply launch\n more instances or launch a instance\
          \ with more CPUs and RAMs. This makes it is\n easy to copy with changes.\
          \ \n \n \n easier software installations. Instances can be used to ship\
          \ entire software\n configuration. The instances can be made as a image\
          \ after configuration, and\n then other users can use the image to launch\
          \ new virtual machines. \n \n \n testing and disaster recovery. Once installed,\

          \ can significantly\n reduce hardware and electricity costs. \n \n \n Some\
          \ terminology \n It is helpful to understand some crucial terminology, especially\
          \ the following\nterms: \n \n \n host: This is the computer system where\
          \ your virtual machine is running on top\n of it. \n \n \n guest operation\
          \ system: This is the operation system that is running inside\n the virtual\

          \ a virtual disk that has\n bootable operation system installed on it. \

  html: "<h2>What is instance (Virtual Machine)</h2>\n<p>An instance (virtual machine)\
    \ is a computing environment completed with virtual\nhardware devices which simulates\
    \ the real computer system. The instance normally\nruns as a process in a physical\
    \ computer system called host and you can boot an\noperating system inside the\
    \ virtual machine. The instance will be tricked as it\nis running on a real computer\
    \ system and it will run just as it would on a real,\nphysical machine.</p>\n\
    <p>Your instance's operating system is stored on a virtual hard drive and it is\n\
    called image. The image is a big, multi-gigabtye file storage stored on storage.\n\
    You can launch a instance by using different images (operating system) and you\n\
    can access it through SSH. As the instance thinks it runs in a 'real' computer\n\
    system, you can do anything just like a normal computer system. However, there\n\
    are still some cases that can be restricted by underline virtual hardware support\n\
    such as 3D graphics.</p>\n<p>The instance doesn't have any knowledge about the\
    \ underline hardware and all\nhardware are done by virtualization. The instance\
    \ only thinks that it uses the\nreal hardware.</p>\n<p>Instances add some overhead\
    \ as there are virtualization layer to support required\nfunctions, so they won't\
    \ be as fast as if you run operating system on real\nhardware.</p>\n<h2>Why is\
    \ virtualization useful</h2>\n<p>The virtualization is useful in the below scenarios:</p>\n\
    <ul>\n<li>\n<p>flexibility. If you need more instances or more computing power,\
    \ simply launch\n more instances or launch a instance with more CPUs and RAMs.\
    \ This makes it is\n easy to copy with changes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>easier software\
    \ installations. Instances can be used to ship entire software\n configuration.\
    \ The instances can be made as a image after configuration, and\n then other users\
    \ can use the image to launch new virtual machines.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>testing\
    \ and disaster recovery. Once installed, a virtual machine can be\n consider as\
    \ a \"container\" (snapshot) that can be arbitrarily frozen, woken up, copied,\n\
    \ backed up and, transported between hosts. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>infrastructure\
    \ consolidation. Virtual machines can significantly\n reduce hardware and electricity\
    \ costs.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Some terminology</h2>\n<p>It is helpful to understand\
    \ some crucial terminology, especially the following\nterms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n\
    <p>host: This is the computer system where your virtual machine is running on\
    \ top\n of it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>guest operation system: This is the operation\
    \ system that is running inside\n the virtual machine.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>virtual\

          \ many tasks such as view,\nterminate, reboot and create a snapshot from\
          \ an instance, etc.  \n Control the state of an instance \n To manage and\
          \ change the state of an instance, you can login to the NeCTAR\nDashboard\
          \ and follow the below steps: \n \n \n login to Dashboard \n \n \n Authenticate\
          \ yourself via AAF \n \n \n Click 'Instances' on the left side of the page\
          \ and click 'Action' drop down\n list for an instance. You should see something\
          \ similar as the below screenshot \n \n \n \n The drop down list includes\
          \ all the available actions you can use to manage the\ninstance. The below\
          \ gives a brief explanation about them: \n \n \n Create Snapshot, create\
          \ a snapshot of instance. The snapshot will save all the\n state of instance\
          \ at the time you taking the snapshot and it can be used an\n image to launch\
          \ a new instance with all the saved state. Only primary disk is\n saved.\
          \ \n \n \n Edit instance, change the name of the instance. \n \n \n Edit\
          \ Security Groups, you can add/delete security groups associated with the\n\
          \ instance. This allows your open/close ports after instance has been launched.\
          \ \n \n \n Console, this action allows you to access the instance via the\
          \ VNC console and\n allow your to access the instance via the web browser.\
          \ \n \n \n View Log, this action allows you view the boot messages that\
          \ normally displayed\n on the standard output (monitor). This is useful\
          \ for debugging. \n \n \n Pause Instance, this action temporarily pauses\
          \ the state of a running instance,\n it is useful for taking a snapshot.\
          \ \n \n \n Suspend Instance, this action stops a running instance. The difference\
          \ between\n pause and suspend is that pause is only for a shot period, all\
          \ resources binded\n to an instance are still available and suspend is for\
          \ long-term and resources may\n be removed. \n \n \n Soft Reboot Instance,\
          \ this action allows users to reboot the running instance. \n \n \n Hard\
          \ Reboot Instance, this action allows users to reboot the running instance.\n\
          \ The difference between soft reboot and hard reboot are that soft reboot\
          \ issues\n reboot signal to the running instance and will do a smooth reboot\
          \ and the hard\n reboot simulates the reboot like pressing the computer\
          \ power button. It is useful\n if the running instance is not responding\
          \ to any commands. \n \n \n Rebuild Instance, use different image to build\
          \ a new instance. The new instance\n maintains the same specification of\
          \ the old instance such as cpus, rams and etc.\n Remember, this action will\
          \ destroy all data in the instance and need to use with\n caution. \n \n\
          \ \n Terminate Instance, permanently delete the instance and data is removed\
          \ as well. \n \n \n You can refer to this document to see more information\
          \ about\nmanaging instances. \n Create instance snapshots \n To create an\
          \ snapshot, you can click 'Create Snapshot' from the above action list\n\
          and you will see a pop-up window like below: \n \n Provide a meaningful\
          \ name and the click 'Create Snapshot' button. \n Notes: You should always\
          \ pause the instance before snapshot it. However, live\nsnapshot is also\
          \ possible and you need to make sure the snapshot is consistent\nwith the\
          \ instance as the snapshot doesn't capture the state of the memory. So\n\
          before snapshot, you need to ensure that: \n \n \n running programs have\
          \ written their contenst to disk \n \n \n the file system does not have\
          \ any 'dirty' buffers \n \n \n For Linux user, you can execute sync to write\
          \ dirty buffer to disk.\nIt is not sufficient to only use sync to get file\
          \ system consistent. It is\nrecommend to use fsfreeze tool. In ubuntu, you\
          \ can run sudo apt-get install util-linux\nto install the fsfreeze tool.\
          \ \n To freeze a file system, you can run fsfreeze -f /mnt as a root user\n\
          in a command line console, where /mnt is the file system mount point. \n\
          \ After you created the snapshot, you can unfreeze the file system by executing\
          \ fsfreeze -u /mnt\nwhere /mnt is the file system mount point. \n You can\
          \ refer to Taking Snapshot for more information. \n Change security group\
          \ \n You can click \"Edit Security groups\" from the drop down list to add/remove\n\
          security group for a running instance. \n \n From the above screenshot,\
          \ You can see the currently applied security groups are\nlisted on the right\
          \ hand side and left hand side is a list of available security\ngroups.\
          \ You can click the plus button to add the available security groups\nto\
          \ the right hand side and click the minus button to remove a security group.\n\
          Once you have done, you can click 'Save' button to save your changes.  \n\
          \ Launch a VNC console \n Sometimes, you need to access your instance directly\
          \ via a web browser and you\ncan do it by using the VNC console. The console\
          \ provides a great way to access\nthe instance if you haven't open port\
          \ for SSH. \n Click the \"console\" item from the drop down list and you\
          \ should see a screenshot\nlike below: \n \n You can then click the 'Click\
          \ here to show only console' and you should see the\nbelow screenshot: \n\
          \ \n After the login prompt appears, you can type in username and password\
          \ to login\nto the instance and perform any task as required. \n View log\
          \ \n The console log provides very useful information that may be required\
          \ in\ntroubleshooting issues. You can access the log by clicking \"view\
          \ log\" item from\nthe action drop down list. After clicking, you should\

    \ and suspend is for long-term and resources may\n be removed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\
    <p>Soft Reboot Instance, this action allows users to reboot the running instance.</p>\n\
    </li>\n<li>\n<p>Hard Reboot Instance, this action allows users to reboot the running\
    \ instance.\n The difference between soft reboot and hard reboot are that soft\
    \ reboot issues\n reboot signal to the running instance and will do a smooth reboot\
    \ and the hard\n reboot simulates the reboot like pressing the computer power\
    \ button. It is useful\n if the running instance is not responding to any commands.</p>\n\
    </li>\n<li>\n<p>Rebuild Instance, use different image to build a new instance.\
    \ The new instance\n maintains the same specification of the old instance such\
    \ as cpus, rams and etc.\n Remember, this action will destroy all data in the\
    \ instance and need to use with\n caution.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Terminate Instance,\
    \ permanently delete the instance and data is removed as well.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\
    <p>You can refer to this <a href=\"http://docs.openstack.org/user-guide/dashboard_launch_instances.html\"\
    >document</a> to see more information about\nmanaging instances.</p>\n<h3>Create\
    \ instance snapshots</h3>\n<p>To create an snapshot, you can click 'Create Snapshot'\
    \ from the above action list\nand you will see a pop-up window like below:</p>\n\
    <p><img alt=\"snapshot\" src=\"https://github.com/NeCTAR-RC/nectarcloud-tier0doco/blob/master/articles/Cloud\
    \ Expert--DOCID19/Instance Management--DOCID39/images/snapshot.png?raw=true\"\
    ></p>\n<p>Provide a meaningful name and the click 'Create Snapshot' button.</p>\n\
    <p>Notes: You should always pause the instance before snapshot it. However, live\n\
    snapshot is also possible and you need to make sure the snapshot is consistent\n\
    with the instance as the snapshot doesn't capture the state of the memory. So\n\
    before snapshot, you need to ensure that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>running programs\
    \ have written their contenst to disk</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the file system does\
    \ not have any 'dirty' buffers</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For Linux user, you can execute\
    \ <code>sync</code> to write dirty buffer to disk.\nIt is not sufficient to only\
    \ use sync to get file system consistent. It is\nrecommend to use fsfreeze tool.\
    \ In ubuntu, you can run <code>sudo apt-get install util-linux</code>\nto install\
    \ the fsfreeze tool.</p>\n<p>To freeze a file system, you can run <code>fsfreeze\
    \ -f /mnt</code> as a root user\nin a command line console, where /mnt is the\
    \ file system mount point.</p>\n<p>After you created the snapshot, you can unfreeze\
    \ the file system by executing <code>fsfreeze -u /mnt</code>\nwhere /mnt is the\
    \ file system mount point.</p>\n<p>You can refer to <a href=\"http://docs.openstack.org/openstack-ops/content/snapshots.html\"\
    >Taking Snapshot</a> for more information.</p>\n<h3>Change security group</h3>\n\
    <p>You can click \"Edit Security groups\" from the drop down list to add/remove\n\
    security group for a running instance.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"instance management\"\
    \ src=\"https://github.com/NeCTAR-RC/nectarcloud-tier0doco/blob/master/articles/Cloud\
    \ Expert--DOCID19/Instance Management--DOCID39/images/security_group.png?raw=true\"\
    ></p>\n<p>From the above screenshot, You can see the currently applied security\
    \ groups are\nlisted on the right hand side and left hand side is a list of available\
    \ security\ngroups. You can click the plus button to add the available security\
    \ groups\nto the right hand side and click the minus button to remove a security\
    \ group.\nOnce you have done, you can click 'Save' button to save your changes.\
    \ </p>\n<h3>Launch a VNC console</h3>\n<p>Sometimes, you need to access your instance\
    \ directly via a web browser and you\ncan do it by using the VNC console. The\
    \ console provides a great way to access\nthe instance if you haven't open port\
    \ for SSH.</p>\n<p>Click the \"console\" item from the drop down list and you\
    \ should see a screenshot\nlike below:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"instance management\"\
    \ src=\"https://github.com/NeCTAR-RC/nectarcloud-tier0doco/blob/master/articles/Cloud\
    \ Expert--DOCID19/Instance Management--DOCID39/images/console1.png?raw=true\"\
    ></p>\n<p>You can then click the 'Click here to show only console' and you should\
    \ see the\nbelow screenshot:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"instance management\" src=\"https://github.com/NeCTAR-RC/nectarcloud-tier0doco/blob/master/articles/Cloud\
    \ Expert--DOCID19/Instance Management--DOCID39/images/console2.png?raw=true\"\
    ></p>\n<p>After the login prompt appears, you can type in username and password\
    \ to login\nto the instance and perform any task as required.</p>\n<h3>View log</h3>\n\
    <p>The console log provides very useful information that may be required in\n\
    troubleshooting issues. You can access the log by clicking \"view log\" item from\n\
    the action drop down list. After clicking, you should see the below screenshot:</p>\n\
    <p><img alt=\"instance management\" src=\"https://github.com/NeCTAR-RC/nectarcloud-tier0doco/blob/master/articles/Cloud\

    <p>This gives you the latest system log messages, if you want to see the full\
    \ logs,\nyou can click the 'View Full Log Button'.</p>\n<h3>create and manage\
    \ volumes</h3>\n<p>You can attach volumes as persistent storage to instances.\
    \ You can attach or\ndetach a volume from a instance at any time and it is also\
    \ easy to create snapshot\nfrom or delete a volume.</p>\n<p>To create a volume,\

        desc_un_html: " Manage instance via API \n The NeCTAR Dashboard is one way\
          \ to manage your instances in projects and NeCTAR\ncloud provides instance\
          \ management via API. There are two types of API you can use\nto manage\
          \ your instance, one is Nova command line API and another is Nova python\n\
          API. Which one to use depends on your needs. The Nova python API is great\
          \ if you\nwant integrate it with python programming to manage instance in\
          \ a programmatic way.\nIf you are a system administrator and you probably\
          \ will prefer to sue Nova command\nline API through a console to manage\
          \ instances. Both of them provides more\nmanagement options than you can\
          \ do through the Dashboard.  \n Installation \n You can use pip to install\
          \ the python-nova API and the nova command line API. \n See below for the\
          \ instructions: \n OS X \n sudo easy_install pip\nsudo pip install --upgrade\
          \ setuptools\nsudo pip install python-novaclient \n Ubuntu \n ```\nsudo\
          \ aptitude install python-pip\nsudo pip install python-novaclient \n ```\
          \ \n RHEL, CentOS, or Fedora \n sudo yum install python-setuptools\nsudo\
          \ easy_install pip\nsudo pip install --upgrade setuptools\nsudo pip install\
          \ python-novaclient \n Windows \n See pip windows for instructions on installing\
          \ pip for Windows. \n pip install python-novaclient \n Configuration \n\
          \ Before you can use the python nova client and command line API you need\
          \ to be\nauthenticated to the NeCTAR cloud. The below shows the instructions\
          \ of how to\nget username/password and get authenticated. \n \n \n Login\
          \ to NeCTAR Cloud Dashboard \n \n \n Click the drop down list beside the\
          \ top left nectar logo to select a project \n \n \n Click 'Access & Security'\
          \ \n \n \n On the 'Access & Security' page, click tab 'API Access' \n \n\
          \ \n Click button \"Download OpenStack RC File\" \n \n \n Save the file\
          \ into a directory \n \n \n Click the drop down list with your email on\
          \ the right top of page, then click\n Settings \n \n \n Click 'Reset Password'\
          \ and save the password appeared on the screen \n \n \n Nova API normally\
          \ requires 4 environment variables to be set for authentication: \n \n auth\
          \ URL \n username \n project id or name (most clients can handle either)\
          \ \n password \n \n When using the script file you downloaded from NeCTAR\
          \ Dashboard, these\nvariables are set by the script file and you can see\
          \ these variables\nif you open the file. Example: \n OS_AUTH_URL: https://keystone.rc.nectar.org.au:5000/v2.0/\n\
          OS_TENANT_NAME=my_science_project\nOS_TENANT_ID=sdfsdfsfwrwewer\nOS_USERNAME=clouduser@example.edu.au\n\
          OS_PASSWORD=XXXXXX \n Authentication for Command Line API \n The below instruction\
          \ assumes you use Linux operating system. \n Once you have obtained the\
          \ authentication script and password, you can execute\nthe script using\
          \ source file-name.sh. and type in the password you\nobtained from Dashboard.\
          \ \n Authentication for python swift API \n You can use the below sample\
          \ code to get authenticated.  \n ``` \n from novaclient import client\n\
          nova = client.Client(VERSION, USERNAME, PASSWORD, PROJECT_NAME, AUTH_URL)\
          \ \n ``` \n The VERSION parameter can be \"1.1\" or \"2\". You can get USERNAME,\
          \ PROJECT_NAME and\nAUTH_URL from the above .sh file obtained from the NeCTAR\
          \ Dashboard and you can\nalso get the PASSWORD from above as copied from\
          \ the NeCTAR Dashboard. \n Nova Command Line API \n you can use nova command\
          \ to manage your instances in a selected project, you can\ntype nova --help\
          \ or just nova to find out all the available\noptions and sub commands.\
          \ \n If you want to know more about a specific sub command,\nexecute nova\
          \ help command-name for help.  \n To list all active instances, execute\
          \ nova list. This should return\nall available instances in one project.\
          \ \n To list all available flavors, execute nova flavor-list. \n To list\
          \ all available images, execute nova image-list. \n To list all available\
          \ security groups, execute nova secgroup-list. \n To list all available\
          \ key pairs, execute nova keypair-list. \n To list all available availability\
          \ zones, execute nova availability-zone-list. \n Note: not all options are\
          \ available as there is a security policy applied and\nyour account might\
          \ not have sufficient permission.  \n The below shows how to create/delete,\
          \ change state of a instance: \n To boot a new instance, you need to get\
          \ image name, keypair name, security group\nname and flavor name. You can\
          \ use the above mentioned commands to acquire these\ninformation. Then,\
          \ you can use nova boot command to launch a new instance, the\nformat is:\
          \ \n ``` \n nova boot [instance-name]  --flavor [name] --image [name] --key-name\
          \ [name]\n--security-groups [names separated by space] \n ``` \n You can\
          \ also specify option --availability-zone to launch an instance in a\ndesigned\
          \ zone and option --user-data  for a initialization script\nused only for\
          \ the first time when instance boots. The user data script can be\nput in\
          \ a file and then passed to instance creation. You can see check this\n\
          website to see what script you can use to initialize an instance.  \n To\
          \ get more help, you can execute nova help boot to see what other\noptions\
          \ are available. \n To boot a stopped instance, use nova start . \n To stop\
          \ an instance, use nova stop . \n To suspend an instance ,use nova suspend\
          \ . \n To show details of an instance, use nova show . \n To resume an instance,\
          \ use nova resume . \n To create a snapshot of a instance, use nova image-create\
          \ \n. \n You can also find more information about nova command line API\
          \ via\nnovaclient. \n Nova Python API \n You can also use Nova Python API\
          \ to manage instances integrated with Python\nprogramming language. \n The\
          \ below shows an sample code to launch a new instance and you need to get\n\
          authentication information first from above: \n ``` \n from novaclient import\
          \ client\nnova = client.Client(\"2\", username, password, project_name,\
          \ auth_url) \n nova.servers.list()\nnova.flavors.list()\nnova.keypairs.list()\n\
          nova.images.list()\nnova.security_groups.list() \n server_name = 'new instance'\n\
          image = 'NeCTAR Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty) amd64'\nflavor = 'm1.small'\nsecurity_groups\
          \ = ['5c8c4dd0-db53-41e3-a53b-9730c764149c', '8cca1fba-b6b2-4ba3-b58e-b568f01e73ff']\n\
          key_name = 'ming' \n nova.servers.create(server_name, image, flavor, security_groups=security_groups,\
          \ key_name=) \n ```  \n You can find more information about nova python\
          \ API from this link "

  html: "<h2>Manage instance via API</h2>\n<p>The NeCTAR Dashboard is one way to manage\
    \ your instances in projects and NeCTAR\ncloud provides instance management via\
    \ API. There are two types of API you can use\nto manage your instance, one is\
    \ Nova command line API and another is Nova python\nAPI. Which one to use depends\
    \ on your needs. The Nova python API is great if you\nwant integrate it with python\
    \ programming to manage instance in a programmatic way.\nIf you are a system administrator\
    \ and you probably will prefer to sue Nova command\nline API through a console\
    \ to manage instances. Both of them provides more\nmanagement options than you\
    \ can do through the Dashboard. </p>\n<h2>Installation</h2>\n<p>You can use pip\
    \ to install the python-nova API and the nova command line API.</p>\n<p>See below\
    \ for the instructions:</p>\n<p>OS X</p>\n<p><code>sudo easy_install pip\nsudo\
    \ pip install --upgrade setuptools\nsudo pip install python-novaclient</code></p>\n\
    <p>Ubuntu</p>\n<p>```\nsudo aptitude install python-pip\nsudo pip install python-novaclient</p>\n\
    <p>```</p>\n<p>RHEL, CentOS, or Fedora</p>\n<p><code>sudo yum install python-setuptools\n\
    sudo easy_install pip\nsudo pip install --upgrade setuptools\nsudo pip install\
    \ python-novaclient</code></p>\n<p>Windows</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/win/\"\
    >pip windows</a> for instructions on installing pip for Windows.</p>\n<p><code>pip\
    \ install python-novaclient</code></p>\n<h2>Configuration</h2>\n<p>Before you\
    \ can use the python nova client and command line API you need to be\nauthenticated\
    \ to the NeCTAR cloud. The below shows the instructions of how to\nget username/password\
    \ and get authenticated.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Login to NeCTAR Cloud <a href=\"\
    https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au\">Dashboard</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click\
    \ the drop down list beside the top left nectar logo to select a project</p>\n\
    </li>\n<li>\n<p>Click 'Access &amp; Security'</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>On the 'Access\
    \ &amp; Security' page, click tab 'API Access'</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click button\
    \ \"Download OpenStack RC File\"</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Save the file into a directory</p>\n\
    </li>\n<li>\n<p>Click the drop down list with your email on the right top of page,\
    \ then click\n Settings</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click 'Reset Password' and save the\
    \ password appeared on the screen</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Nova API normally requires\
    \ 4 environment variables to be set for authentication:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>auth URL</li>\n\
    <li>username</li>\n<li>project id or name (most clients can handle either)</li>\n\
    <li>password</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When using the script file you downloaded from NeCTAR\
    \ Dashboard, these\nvariables are set by the script file and you can see these\
    \ variables\nif you open the file. Example:</p>\n<p>OS_AUTH_URL: https://keystone.rc.nectar.org.au:5000/v2.0/\n\
    OS_TENANT_NAME=my_science_project\nOS_TENANT_ID=sdfsdfsfwrwewer\nOS_USERNAME=clouduser@example.edu.au\n\
    OS_PASSWORD=XXXXXX</p>\n<h3>Authentication for Command Line API</h3>\n<p>The below\
    \ instruction assumes you use Linux operating system.</p>\n<p>Once you have obtained\
    \ the authentication script and password, you can execute\nthe script using <code>source\
    \ file-name.sh</code>. and type in the password you\nobtained from Dashboard.</p>\n\
    <h3>Authentication for python swift API</h3>\n<p>You can use the below sample\
    \ code to get authenticated. </p>\n<p>```</p>\n<p>from novaclient import client\n\
    nova = client.Client(VERSION, USERNAME, PASSWORD, PROJECT_NAME, AUTH_URL)</p>\n\
    <p>```</p>\n<p>The VERSION parameter can be \"1.1\" or \"2\". You can get USERNAME,\
    \ PROJECT_NAME and\nAUTH_URL from the above .sh file obtained from the NeCTAR\
    \ Dashboard and you can\nalso get the PASSWORD from above as copied from the NeCTAR\
    \ Dashboard.</p>\n<h2>Nova Command Line API</h2>\n<p>you can use nova command\
    \ to manage your instances in a selected project, you can\ntype <code>nova --help</code>\
    \ or just <code>nova</code> to find out all the available\noptions and sub commands.</p>\n\
    <p>If you want to know more about a specific sub command,\nexecute <code>nova\
    \ help command-name</code> for help. </p>\n<p>To list all active instances, execute\
    \ <code>nova list</code>. This should return\nall available instances in one project.</p>\n\
    <p>To list all available flavors, execute <code>nova flavor-list</code>.</p>\n\
    <p>To list all available images, execute <code>nova image-list</code>.</p>\n<p>To\
    \ list all available security groups, execute <code>nova secgroup-list</code>.</p>\n\
    <p>To list all available key pairs, execute <code>nova keypair-list</code>.</p>\n\
    <p>To list all available availability zones, execute <code>nova availability-zone-list</code>.</p>\n\
    <p>Note: not all options are available as there is a security policy applied and\n\
    your account might not have sufficient permission. </p>\n<p>The below shows how\
    \ to create/delete, change state of a instance:</p>\n<p>To boot a new instance,\
    \ you need to get image name, keypair name, security group\nname and flavor name.\
    \ You can use the above mentioned commands to acquire these\ninformation. Then,\
    \ you can use nova boot command to launch a new instance, the\nformat is:</p>\n\
    <p>```</p>\n<p>nova boot [instance-name]  --flavor [name] --image [name] --key-name\
    \ [name]\n--security-groups [names separated by space]</p>\n<p>```</p>\n<p>You\
    \ can also specify option --availability-zone to launch an instance in a\ndesigned\
    \ zone and option --user-data <user-data-file> for a initialization script\nused\
    \ only for the first time when instance boots. The user data script can be\nput\

          \ API takes more effects as it depends on how familiar\nwith Python programming\
          \ and what development environment you use. \n The below provides some basic\
          \ information about how you debug the Nova Python\nAPI. \n You can debug\
          \ your python code using Python debugger called pdb and you can find\nmore\
          \ information here. \n The below code uses pdb debuuger to debug a python\
          \ file contains clinet python\nAPI code. \n pdb file_name.py \n Once you\
          \ executed the above code, the command line will be stopped on the first\n\

          \ \n Some useful ones to use are: \n \n \n b: set a breakpoint \n \n \n\
          \ c: continue debugging until you hit a breakpoint \n \n \n s: step through\

          \ \n d: navigate down a stack frame \n \n \n p: to print the value of an\
          \ expression in the current context \n \n \n Debugging Via HTTP \n The both\
          \ of command line API and python API are restful web service client.\nThus\
          \ the requests are all made by using HTTP and you can always refer to\n\
          OpenStack Service End for further references about what should be\npresented\
          \ in the HTTP requests. The Nova API uses requests library\nto send and\
          \ receive HTTP requests/responses. \n For command line client, you can add\
          \ --debug option to print out HTTP request\nheader and HTTP response header,\
          \ which give you a lot of more insight\ninformation. To verify parameters\
          \ in the request header, you can refer to\nOpenStack service {API]api to\
          \ see what are expected. \n To enable debugging information on the standard\
          \ out for Python API, you can add\nthe below code: \n ```\nimport logging\n\
          logger = logging.getLogger(\"novaclient\")\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)\
          \ \n ``` \n The will print the same output as adding --debug option for\
          \ command line API. \n Debugging via Source Code \n If the above techniques\
          \ are still not helpful, you can always look at the source\ncode to find\
          \ the problems. \n The below source file structure is based on the installation\
          \ in Ubuntu. \n The command line nova command is located in /usr/bin/nova.\
          \ By looking at this\nfile, you should get a idea of how the various options\
          \ are interpreted. This file\nacts as an interface for Python API. \n The\
          \ Python API files are located under\n/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/novaclient\
          \ and the most important file to look\nat is client.py. This file does all\
          \ the request preparation, sending request and\nreceiving response. It is\
          \ also used by the command line Nova client.  "

          <p>For command line client, you can add --debug option to print out HTTP

  html: '<h2>Debugging Nova Command line Client</h2>

    <p>The below assumes you have installed Nova command client in a Linux

    environment. If you have other operating systems, the debugging process might
    be

    a slightly different, however, the general rules should still apply.</p>

    <p>Nova command line client is very much like other Linux commands, it outputs

    errors in the standard output, which is the monitor.</p>

    <p>If you get an error, you can always read the error message and generally it
    give

    you very good hints about what might be wrong.</p>

    <p>For example, if you execute <code>nova service-list</code> on the command line
    without

    authentication, the error message might look like this:</p>

    <p>```

    ERROR: You must provide a username via either --os-username or env[OS_USERNAME]</p>

    <p>```</p>

    <p>The above message indicates you need to be authenticated before you can use
    the

    API. The authentication requires some environment variables to be set. To set

    these environment variables you can either source the script file obtained from

    NeCTAR <a href="https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au">Dashboard</a> or you can override
    it by using command line options.</p>

    <p>You can always execute <code>man nova`` or simply</code>nova``` to get more
    help

    information and to learn each supported options.</p>

    <p>If you find a useful command, you can also execute <code>nova help command</code>,

    this will give your more specific help for the command.</p>

    <h2>Debugging Nova Python API</h2>

    <p>Debugging Nova Python API takes more effects as it depends on how familiar

    with Python programming and what development environment you use.</p>

    <p>The below provides some basic information about how you debug the Nova Python

    API.</p>

    <p>You can debug your python code using Python debugger called pdb and you can
    find

    more information <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/pdb.html">here</a>.</p>

    <p>The below code uses pdb debuuger to debug a python file contains clinet python

    API code.</p>

    <p><code>pdb file_name.py</code></p>

    <p>Once you executed the above code, the command line will be stopped on the first

    line of code and you can use some commands to control the execution flow.</p>

    <p>Some useful ones to use are:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>

    <p>b: set a breakpoint</p>

    </li>

    <li>

    <p>c: continue debugging until you hit a breakpoint</p>

    </li>

    <li>

    <p>s: step through the code</p>

    </li>

    <li>

    <p>n: to go to next line of code</p>

    </li>

    <li>

    <p>l: list source code for the current file</p>

    </li>

    <li>

    <p>u : navigate up a stack frame</p>

    </li>

    <li>

    <p>d: navigate down a stack frame</p>

    </li>

    <li>

    <p>p: to print the value of an expression in the current context</p>

    </li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Debugging Via HTTP</h2>

    <p>The both of command line API and python API are restful web service client.

    Thus the requests are all made by using HTTP and you can always refer to

    <a href="http://developer.openstack.org/api-ref-objectstorage-v1.html">OpenStack
    Service End</a> for further references about what should be

    presented in the HTTP requests. The Nova API uses <a href="http://www.python-requests.org/en/latest/">requests</a>
    library

    to send and receive HTTP requests/responses.</p>

    <p>For command line client, you can add --debug option to print out HTTP request

    header and HTTP response header, which give you a lot of more insight

    information. To verify parameters in the request header, you can refer to

    OpenStack service {API]<a href="http://developer.openstack.org/api-ref-objectstorage-v1.html">api</a>
    to see what are expected.</p>

    <p>To enable debugging information on the standard out for Python API, you can
    add

    the below code:</p>

    <p>```

    import logging

    logger = logging.getLogger("novaclient")

    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)</p>

    <p>```</p>

    <p>The will print the same output as adding --debug option for command line API.</p>

    <h2>Debugging via Source Code</h2>

    <p>If the above techniques are still not helpful, you can always look at the source

    code to find the problems.</p>

    <p>The below source file structure is based on the installation in Ubuntu.</p>

          \ panel\nthere is a side menu heading named \"Orchestration\". It has a\
          \ sub menu entry\ntitled \"Stacks\": \n \n When you select it you will see\
          \ a list of the stacks that you have created, and\nto the top right, a button\
          \ pair, one labelled \"+ Launch Stack\", the other\n\"\u2716 Delete Stack\"\
          : \n \n Pressing the \"+ Launch Stack\" button creates a dialogue that invites\
          \ you to\nprovide a Heat template. \n \n The dialogue offers you three ways\
          \ of providing a template via the \"Template Source\"\ndrop down: \n \n\
          \ \nURL - The template can be reached via a web browser, and you are going\
          \ to\n  provide the URL it can be found at; \n \nFile - You are going to\
          \ upload the template from your local machine; \n \nDirect Input - You will\
          \ type the template in by hand. \n \n Dependent on which selection you make\
          \ in the \"Template Source\" drop down, the\ndialogue will reconfigure itself\
          \ to allow you to provide the required information. \n The dialogue also\
          \ offers you the chance to provide an \"Environment Source\".\nThis is also\
          \ in the form of a drop down, but here the choices are limited\nto: \n \n\
          \ \nFile - You are going to upload the environment from your local machine;\
          \ \n \nDirect Input - You will type the environment in by hand. \n \n Again,\
          \ dependant on which selection you make, the dialogue will reconfigure\n\
          itself to allow you to provide the required information. \n An environment\n\
          simply allows you to provide parameter values and to define custom resources.\
          \ \n In this example we are going to use one of the NeCTAR Heat sample templates.\
          \ \n So in the Template Source field select \"URL\", then in the \"Template\
          \ URL\" field\nenter: \n https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NeCTAR-RC/heat-templates/master/juno/Fedora/wordpress_single_instance.yaml\
          \ \n Then in the Environment Source field select \"Direct Input\", then\
          \ in the environment\ndata edit box type the following yaml (taking care\
          \ to enter the correct values): \n yaml\nparameters:\n  # your nectar keypair\
          \ name instead of 'nectar_demo'\n  key_name: nectar_demo\n  # the latest\
          \ nectar fedora image id\n  fedora_image_id: db354243-aba2-4831-81c7-a155b9089291\
          \ \n Once you are done press the \"Next\" button. \n All going well, you\
          \ should now be presented with a page titled \"Launch Stack\".\nIt will\
          \ be a form that is made up of fields that are taken from your template's\n\
          parameters. \n Next to each field is a small question mark icon. As it gains\
          \ focus, so the user\nwill be shows the parameters comment field as a help\
          \ bubble to the right. \n \n The value entered into the \"Stack Name\" field\
          \ is used to give a name to the stack\nthat is going to be launched by Heat.\
          \ This name must start with a letter and may\nonly contain letters, numbers,\
          \ underscores, full stops and hyphens... \n The \"Creation Timeout (minutes)\"\
          \ field is the number of minutes that should be\nallowed for the stack creation\
          \ to take. If this time is exceeded then the stack\ncreation will be aborted.\
          \ \n The \"Rollback On Failure\" field, if checked, will ensure that the\
          \ complete\nstack gets deleted if there is a failure in creation. If it's\
          \ not checked then\nyou will have to manually delete the stack should there\
          \ be a failure in the creation. \n The rest of the fields are taken from\
          \ the template that has been uploaded.\nYou should find that the values\
          \ you entered in the environment file\nhave been used to fill the fields.\
          \ Otherwise, simply provide the requested\nvalues then select the \"Launch\"\
          \ button. \n All going well, the stack should be created. Once created you\
          \ can select it\nin the lists of stacks that are active, drilling down into\
          \ its\nparticular details. \n When you are finished with a stack, you can\
          \ simply hit the \"Delete\" button\nnext to it on the stack listings. If\
          \ you want to delete more than one\nstack, select the checkboxes next to\

          \ have installed swift command client in a Linux\nenvironment. If you have\
          \ other operating systems, the debugging process might be\na slightly different,\
          \ however, the general rules should still apply. \n Swift command line client\
          \ is very much like other Linux commands, it outputs\nerrors in the standard\
          \ output, which is the monitor. \n If you get an error, you can always read\
          \ the error message and generally it give\nyou very good hints about what\
          \ might be wrong. \n For example, if you execute swift list on the command\
          \ line without\nauthentication, the error message might look like this:\
          \ \n ```\nAuth version 1.0 requires ST_AUTH, ST_USER, and ST_KEY environment\
          \ variables\nto be set or overridden with -A, -U, or -K. \n Auth version\
          \ 2.0 requires OS_AUTH_URL, OS_USERNAME, OS_PASSWORD, and\nOS_TENANT_NAME\
          \ OS_TENANT_ID to be set or overridden with --os-auth-url,\n--os-username,\
          \ --os-password, --os-tenant-name or os-tenant-id. Note:\nadding \"-V 2\"\
          \ is necessary for this.\n``` \n The above message indicates you that there\
          \ are 2 authentication versions that\nswift currently supports and each\
          \ version requires some environment variables\nto be set. To set these environment\
          \ variables you can either source the script\nfile downloaded from NeCTAR\
          \ Dashboard or you can override it by\nusing command line options. \n You\
          \ can always execute man swift`` or simplyswift``` to get more help\ninformation\
          \ and to learn each supported options. \n If you find a useful command,\
          \ you can also execute swift command --help,\nthis will give your more specific\
          \ help for the command. \n Debugging Client Python API \n Debugging client\
          \ Python API takes more effects as it depends on how familiar\nwith Python\
          \ programming and what development environment you use. \n The below provides\
          \ some basic information about how you debug the client Python\nAPI. \n\
          \ You can debug your python code using Python debugger called pdb and you\
          \ can find\nmore information here. \n The below code uses pdb debuuger to\
          \ debug a python file contains clinet python\nAPI code. \n pdb file_name.py\
          \ \n Once you executed the above code, the command line will be stopped\
          \ on the first\nline of code and you can use some commands to control the\
          \ execution flow. \n Some useful ones to use are: \n \n \n b: set a breakpoint\
          \ \n \n \n c: continue debugging until you hit a breakpoint \n \n \n s:\
          \ step through the code \n \n \n n: to go to next line of code \n \n \n\
          \ l: list source code for the current file \n \n \n u : navigate up a stack\
          \ frame \n \n \n d: navigate down a stack frame \n \n \n p: to print the\
          \ value of an expression in the current context \n \n \n Debugging Via HTTP\
          \ \n The both of command line API and python API are restful web service\
          \ client.\nThus the requests are all made by using HTTP and you can always\
          \ refer to\nOpenStack Service End for further references about what should\
          \ be\npresented in the HTTP requests. The swift API uses requests library\n\
          to send and receive HTTP requests/responses. \n For command line client,\
          \ you can add --debug option to print out HTTP request\nheader and HTTP\
          \ response header, which give you a lot of more insight\ninformation. To\
          \ verify parameters in the request header, you can refer to\nOpenStack service\
          \ {API]api to see what are expected. \n To enable debugging information\
          \ on the standard out for Python API, you can add\nthe below code: \n ```\n\
          import logging\nlogger = logging.getLogger(\"swiftclient\")\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)\
          \ \n ``` \n The will print the same output as adding --debug option for\
          \ command line API. \n Debugging via Source Code \n If the above techniques\
          \ are still not helpful, you can always look at the source\ncode to find\
          \ the problems. \n The below source file structure is based on the installation\
          \ in Ubuntu. \n The command line swift command is located in /usr/bin/swift.\
          \ By looking at this\nfile, you should get a idea of how the various options\
          \ are interpreted. This file\nacts as an interface for Python API. \n The\
          \ Python API files are located under\n/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/swiftclient\
          \ and the most important file to look\nat is client.py. This is file does\

    to see what are expected.</p>

    <p>To enable debugging information on the standard out for Python API, you can
    add

    the below code:</p>

    <p>```

    import logging

    logger = logging.getLogger("swiftclient")

    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)</p>

    <p>```</p>

    <p>The will print the same output as adding --debug option for command line API.</p>

    <h2>Debugging via Source Code</h2>

    <p>If the above techniques are still not helpful, you can always look at the source

    code to find the problems.</p>

    <p>The below source file structure is based on the installation in Ubuntu.</p>

    <p>The command line swift command is located in /usr/bin/swift. By looking at
    this

    file, you should get a idea of how the various options are interpreted. This file

    acts as an interface for Python API.</p>

    <p>The Python API files are located under

    /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/swiftclient and the most important file to look

    at is client.py. This is file does all the request preparation, sending request

    and receiving response. It is also used by the command line swift client. </p>'

        desc_un_html: " Security API \n The NeCTAR Cloud doesn't provide a specific\
          \ API for security purpose. The only\nsecurity relevant operation is to\
          \ manage security groups through the Nova API.\nIf you want to know the\
          \ Nova API, You can find the related information from the\narticles in Instance\
          \ Management section. \n This article describes some techniques to help\
          \ you to secure a Linux based\nvirtual machine in NeCTAR cloud. \n As security\
          \ is really large topic, the techniques showed here only provides some\n\
          basic introduction. You can always go to Internet and find more useful information\n\
          about Security. \n The below assumes your operating system is debian/ubuntu.\
          \ \n Securing ssh \n You need to encourage all the users on your system\
          \ to use ssh certificate\nauthentication and disable password login. In\
          \ addition, you need to avoid logging\ninto the system using ssh as root\
          \ and use alternative methods to become root,\nsuch as su or sudo. \n To\
          \ change the ssh configuration, you can edit the sshd_config file, in /etc/ssh.\n\
          The below gives basic description about some important configuration items:\
          \ \n \n \n PermitRootLogin no\n You need to set this to no to avoid root\
          \ access via ssh \n \n \n Port 22\n For better security, you can change\
          \ the ssh port to other port number \n \n \n PermitEmptyPasswords no\n \
          \ This should be always no, for non empty password access \n \n \n AllowUsers\n\
          \  This directive allows only certain users to have access via ssh to this\
          \ machine. \n \n \n PasswordAuthentication No\n  You should set this to\
          \ no to disable user logging using password \n \n \n After you have changed\
          \ the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file, you can execute sudo service ssh restart\n\
          to apply the new changes. \n If you are using an SSH client to access your\
          \ Virtual Machine, you need to make\nsure both SSH server and client are\
          \ using the same version of protocols. \n You can also restrict access to\
          \ file transfer only if you want to allow accounts\non your Virtual Machine\
          \ to transfer files. You can do it by giving users a\nrestricted shell such\
          \ as scpoly or rssh. These shells restrict the commands\navailable to the\
          \ users to execute. You can change an account's shell by editing\n/etc/passwd\
          \ file. \n Securing Apache \n If you don't want your Apache web service\
          \ available to public, you can use the\nListen or BindAddress directives\
          \ in /etc/apache2/apache2.conf. \n Using Listen:\n    Listen 127.0.0.1:80\n\
          Using BindAddress:\n    BindAddress 127.0.0.1 \n Then you can restart your\
          \ apache service with sudo service apache2 restart \n The default Apache\
          \ installation in Debian permits users to publish content\nunder the $HOME/public_html.\
          \ This content can be retrieved remotely using an\nURL such as: http://your_apache_server/~user.\
          \ \n You can restrict the default configuration by editing /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/userdir.conf\
          \ \n You can also make sure the permission of log files can only be read/write\
          \ by\nrequired user and groups. The default permission for the log files\
          \ may be readable\nby anyone. \n By default, Apache web files are located\
          \ under /var/www. The default file provides\nsome hints on the system like\
          \ what is the operating system. You should substitute\nthe default web pages\
          \ with your own. \n to further harder the Apache security, you can run Apache\
          \ by chroot. See this\ninstruction to set up Apache. \n Keep System Update\
          \ to Date \n In debian/ubuntu, you run sudo apt-get update regularly to\
          \ keep system\nsecurity patch update to date. \n Setup Local Firewall \n\
          \ A local firewall can also be installed with filtering rules to protect\
          \ access to\nthe system. You can use iptable tools to create rules to filter\
          \ network traffic.\nIt is advised to use Security Group to manage which\
          \ ports to open as it is simple\nto do. The below only provides basic introduction\
          \ to IPtables, for more\ninformation, please refer to IPtables MAN page.\
          \ \n To list all current rules, execute:  sudo iptables --list \n By default,\
          \ the IPtables defines 3 chains. The INPUT Chain is for incoming traffic\n\
          , the Forward Chain is for forwarded traffic and the OUTPUT Chain is for\
          \ outgoing\ntraffic. Which chains you need to add rules depends on what\
          \ traffic you want to\nfilter. \n IPtables also defines policies that defines\
          \ actions for rules: \n \n \n Accept, accept traffic \n \n \n Reject, reject\
          \ traffic by sending back an error packet \n \n \n Drop, reject traffic\
          \ by dropping traffic \n \n \n The below shows an example how to enable\
          \ SSH and HTTP/HTTPS traffic in IPtables. \n Firstly, you need to allow\
          \ connections that are already connected to your server: \n sudo iptables\
          \ - I INPUT 1 -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT \n Secondly, you need to allow\
          \ SSH connections: \n sudo iptables -I INPUT 1 -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT\
          \ \n Thirdly, you can allow HTTP/HTTPS traffic: \n sudo iptables -I INPUT\
          \ 1 -p tcp -dport 80 -j ACCEPT\nsudo iptables -I INPUT 1 -p tcp --dport\
          \ 443 -j ACCEPT \n Finally, you need to drop all other traffic. You need\
          \ to make sure you have set\nto allow SSH connection, otherwise you will\
          \ lose access to the Virtual Machine: \n ``` \n sudo iptables -P INPUT DROP\
          \ \n ``` \n You can save your IPtables changes by (Ubuntu):  \n ```  \n\
          \ iptables-save > /etc/iptables.rules \n ``` \n Install fail2ban \n The\
          \ SSH daemon itself is a Linux service that exposed to the Internet and\
          \ creates\na security risk for the system. fail2ban can mitigate this problem\
          \ by creating\nrules that can automatically alter your your iptables firewall\
          \ and ban\nunsuccessful login attempts based on a predefined number.  \n\
          \ You can use the below commands to install fail2ban in Ubuntu: \n ``` \n\
          \ sudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install fail2ban \n ``` \n To setup\
          \ the fail2ban, please follow this instruction. \n Disable Unneeded Services\
          \ \n Unneeded services are a potential security risk, so you can execute\

        description: "<h2>Security API</h2>\n<p>The NeCTAR Cloud doesn't provide a\
          \ specific API for security purpose. The only\nsecurity relevant operation\
          \ is to manage security groups through the Nova API.\nIf you want to know\
          \ the Nova API, You can find the related information from the\narticles\
          \ in Instance Management section.</p>\n<p>This article describes some techniques\
          \ to help you to secure a Linux based\nvirtual machine in NeCTAR cloud.</p>\n\
          <p>As security is really large topic, the techniques showed here only provides\
          \ some\nbasic introduction. You can always go to Internet and find more\
          \ useful information\nabout Security.</p>\n<p>The below assumes your operating\
          \ system is debian/ubuntu.</p>\n<h2>Securing ssh</h2>\n<p>You need to encourage\
          \ all the users on your system to use ssh certificate\nauthentication and\
          \ disable password login. In addition, you need to avoid logging\ninto the\
          \ system using ssh as root and use alternative methods to become root,\n\
          such as su or sudo.</p>\n<p>To change the ssh configuration, you can edit\
          \ the sshd_config file, in /etc/ssh.\nThe below gives basic description\
          \ about some important configuration items:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>PermitRootLogin\
          \ no\n You need to set this to no to avoid root access via ssh</p>\n</li>\n\
          <li>\n<p>Port 22\n For better security, you can change the ssh port to other\
          \ port number</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>PermitEmptyPasswords no\n  This should\
          \ be always no, for non empty password access</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>AllowUsers\n\
          \  This directive allows only certain users to have access via ssh to this\
          \ machine.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>PasswordAuthentication No\n  You should\
          \ set this to no to disable user logging using password</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\
          <p>After you have changed the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file, you can execute\
          \ <code>sudo service ssh restart</code>\nto apply the new changes.</p>\n\
          <p>If you are using an SSH client to access your Virtual Machine, you need\
          \ to make\nsure both SSH server and client are using the same version of\
          \ protocols.</p>\n<p>You can also restrict access to file transfer only\
          \ if you want to allow accounts\non your Virtual Machine to transfer files.\
          \ You can do it by giving users a\nrestricted shell such as scpoly or rssh.\
          \ These shells restrict the commands\navailable to the users to execute.\
          \ You can change an account's shell by editing\n/etc/passwd file.</p>\n\
          <h2>Securing Apache</h2>\n<p>If you don't want your Apache web service available\
          \ to public, you can use the\nListen or BindAddress directives in /etc/apache2/apache2.conf.</p>\n\
          <p>Using Listen:\n    Listen 127.0.0.1:80\nUsing BindAddress:\n    BindAddress\
          \ 127.0.0.1</p>\n<p>Then you can restart your apache service with <code>sudo\
          \ service apache2 restart</code></p>\n<p>The default Apache installation\
          \ in Debian permits users to publish content\nunder the $HOME/public_html.\
          \ This content can be retrieved remotely using an\nURL such as: http://your_apache_server/~user.</p>\n\
          <p>You can restrict the default configuration by editing /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/userdir.conf</p>\n\
          <p>You can also make sure the permission of log files can only be read/write\
          \ by\nrequired user and groups. The default permission for the log files\
          \ may be readable\nby anyone.</p>\n<p>By default, Apache web files are located\
          \ under /var/www. The default file provides\nsome hints on the system like\
          \ what is the operating system. You should substitute\nthe default web pages\
          \ with your own.</p>\n<p>to further harder the Apache security, you can\
          \ run Apache by chroot. See this\n<a href=\"https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ap-chroot-apache-env.en.html\"\
          >instruction</a> to set up Apache.</p>\n<h2>Keep System Update to Date</h2>\n\
          <p>In debian/ubuntu, you run <code>sudo apt-get update</code> regularly\
          \ to keep system\nsecurity patch update to date.</p>\n<h2>Setup Local Firewall</h2>\n\
          <p>A local firewall can also be installed with filtering rules to protect\
          \ access to\nthe system. You can use iptable tools to create rules to filter\
          \ network traffic.\nIt is advised to use Security Group to manage which\
          \ ports to open as it is simple\nto do. The below only provides basic introduction\
          \ to IPtables, for more\ninformation, please refer to IPtables <a href=\"\
          http://linux.die.net/man/8/iptables\">MAN page</a>.</p>\n<p>To list all\
          \ current rules, execute:  <code>sudo iptables --list</code></p>\n<p>By\
          \ default, the IPtables defines 3 chains. The INPUT Chain is for incoming\
          \ traffic\n, the Forward Chain is for forwarded traffic and the OUTPUT Chain\
          \ is for outgoing\ntraffic. Which chains you need to add rules depends on\
          \ what traffic you want to\nfilter.</p>\n<p>IPtables also defines policies\
          \ that defines actions for rules:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Accept, accept traffic</p>\n\
          </li>\n<li>\n<p>Reject, reject traffic by sending back an error packet</p>\n\
          </li>\n<li>\n<p>Drop, reject traffic by dropping traffic</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\
          <p>The below shows an example how to enable SSH and HTTP/HTTPS traffic in\
          \ IPtables.</p>\n<p>Firstly, you need to allow connections that are already\
          \ connected to your server:</p>\n<p><code>sudo iptables - I INPUT 1 -p tcp\
          \ --dport 22 -j ACCEPT</code></p>\n<p>Secondly, you need to allow SSH connections:</p>\n\
          <p><code>sudo iptables -I INPUT 1 -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT</code></p>\n\
          <p>Thirdly, you can allow HTTP/HTTPS traffic:</p>\n<p><code>sudo iptables\
          \ -I INPUT 1 -p tcp -dport 80 -j ACCEPT</code>\n<code>sudo iptables -I INPUT\
          \ 1 -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT</code></p>\n<p>Finally, you need to drop\
          \ all other traffic. You need to make sure you have set\nto allow SSH connection,\
          \ otherwise you will lose access to the Virtual Machine:</p>\n<p>```</p>\n\
          <p>sudo iptables -P INPUT DROP</p>\n<p>```</p>\n<p>You can save your IPtables\
          \ changes by (Ubuntu): </p>\n<p>``` </p>\n<p>iptables-save &gt; /etc/iptables.rules</p>\n\
          <p>```</p>\n<h2>Install fail2ban</h2>\n<p>The SSH daemon itself is a Linux\
          \ service that exposed to the Internet and creates\na security risk for\
          \ the system. fail2ban can mitigate this problem by creating\nrules that\
          \ can automatically alter your your iptables firewall and ban\nunsuccessful\
          \ login attempts based on a predefined number. </p>\n<p>You can use the\
          \ below commands to install fail2ban in Ubuntu:</p>\n<p>```</p>\n<p>sudo\
          \ apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install fail2ban</p>\n<p>```</p>\n<p>To setup\
          \ the fail2ban, please follow this <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-protect-ssh-with-fail2ban-on-ubuntu-14-04\"\
          >instruction</a>.</p>\n<h2>Disable Unneeded Services</h2>\n<p>Unneeded services\
          \ are a potential security risk, so you can execute <code>sudo service --status-all</code>\n\
          to list all available services.  You can exam the output carefully and disable\n\
          any services not desired.</p>"

          \ uses Australian Access Federation for its authentication.\nIf you have\
          \ any problems with the login, you can contact the IT helpdesk in your\n\
          local organization or institution. You can log a ticket in the NeCTAR\n\
          helpdesk. You can also submit a help request to aaf\nhelpdesk for help.\
          \ \n Debugging API Authentication \n You must first send an authentication\
          \ request to OpenStack Identity service to\nget an authentication token\
          \ before you can access API services. To request an\nauthentication token,\
          \ you must supply the credentials in the authentication request. \n The\
          \ credentials are a combination of username, password and project name.\
          \ You also\nneed to get the authentication URL for credentials validation.\
          \ \n You need to make sure you have the correct Credentials download from\
          \ the NeCTAR\nDashboard. Before you use them, please check the username,\
          \ projet name and the\nAPI endpoints. You can reference these information\
          \ from the script file you\nobtained from the NeCTAR Dashboard. \n After\
          \ you send the username/password and project name to the authentication\
          \ URL,\nYou will get a authentication token. Then, you need to include the\
          \ token in the\nX-Auth-Token HTTP header. If you access multiple API services,\
          \ you must get a\ntoken for each API service. The token has a limited time\
          \ and can become invalid\nfor other reasons. \n Authentication and API request\
          \ workflow \n \n \n Send a request with credentials to get a token from\
          \ the Identity endpoint. If\n the request succeeds, the server returns an\
          \ authentication token. \n \n \n Send API requests and include the token\
          \ in the X-Auth-Token HTTP header. The\n following HTTP requests use the\
          \ same token until the requests complete. \n \n \n If a 401 Unauthorized\
          \ error returned, the request requires a new token. \n \n \n Debug Authentication\
          \ \n The below use cURL commands to show your how to debug authentication\
          \ request.\nFor information about cURL, see http://curl.haxx.se/. For information\n\
          about the OpenStack APIs, see OpenStack API Reference. \n To get a valid\
          \ token, you need 3 parameters: \n \n \n username \n \n \n password \n \n\
          \ \n project name/project id \n \n \n The below shows a code to get token:\
          \ \n ``` \n curl -s -X POST https://keystone.rc.nectar.org.au:5000/v2.0/tokens\
          \ \\\n            -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n           \
          \ -d '{\"auth\": {\"tenantName\": \"'\"$OS_TENANT_NAME\"'\", \"passwordCredentials\"\
          :\n            {\"username\": \"'\"$OS_USERNAME\"'\", \"password\": \"'\"\
          $OS_PASSWORD\"'\"}}}' \\\n            | python -m json.tool \n ``` \n You\
          \ need to replace the username, password and tenantname with the values\
          \ in\nthe authentication script file you obtained from the NeCTAR Dashboard.\
          \ \n The response would look like below: \n ```\n{\n    \"access\": {\n\

        description: "<h2>Debugging Dashboard Authentication</h2>\n<p>The NeCTAR Dashboard\
          \ uses <a href=\"http://aaf.edu.au/\">Australian Access Federation</a> for\
          \ its authentication.\nIf you have any problems with the login, you can\
          \ contact the IT helpdesk in your\nlocal organization or institution. You\
          \ can log a ticket in the NeCTAR\n<a href=\"https://support.nectar.org.au/support/home\"\
          >helpdesk</a>. You can also submit a help request to aaf\n<a href=\"http://support.aaf.edu.au/home\"\
          >helpdesk</a> for help.</p>\n<h2>Debugging API Authentication</h2>\n<p>You\
          \ must first send an authentication request to OpenStack Identity service\
          \ to\nget an authentication token before you can access API services. To\
          \ request an\nauthentication token, you must supply the credentials in the\
          \ authentication request.</p>\n<p>The credentials are a combination of username,\
          \ password and project name. You also\nneed to get the authentication URL\
          \ for credentials validation.</p>\n<p>You need to make sure you have the\
          \ correct Credentials download from the NeCTAR\nDashboard. Before you use\
          \ them, please check the username, projet name and the\nAPI endpoints. You\
          \ can reference these information from the script file you\nobtained from\
          \ the NeCTAR Dashboard.</p>\n<p>After you send the username/password and\
          \ project name to the authentication URL,\nYou will get a authentication\
          \ token. Then, you need to include the token in the\nX-Auth-Token HTTP header.\
          \ If you access multiple API services, you must get a\ntoken for each API\
          \ service. The token has a limited time and can become invalid\nfor other\
          \ reasons.</p>\n<h3>Authentication and API request workflow</h3>\n<ul>\n\
          <li>\n<p>Send a request with credentials to get a token from the Identity\
          \ endpoint. If\n the request succeeds, the server returns an authentication\
          \ token.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Send API requests and include the token in\
          \ the X-Auth-Token HTTP header. The\n following HTTP requests use the same\
          \ token until the requests complete.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If a 401 Unauthorized\
          \ error returned, the request requires a new token.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\
          <h3>Debug Authentication</h3>\n<p>The below use cURL commands to show your\
          \ how to debug authentication request.\nFor information about cURL, see\
          \ <a href=\"http://curl.haxx.se/\">http://curl.haxx.se/</a>. For information\n\
          about the OpenStack APIs, see <a href=\"http://developer.openstack.org/api-ref.html\"\
          >OpenStack API Reference</a>.</p>\n<p>To get a valid token, you need 3 parameters:</p>\n\
          <ul>\n<li>\n<p>username</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>password</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n\
          <p>project name/project id</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The below shows a code\
          \ to get token:</p>\n<p>```</p>\n<p>curl -s -X POST https://keystone.rc.nectar.org.au:5000/v2.0/tokens\
          \ \\\n            -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n           \

  html: "<h2>Debugging Dashboard Authentication</h2>\n<p>The NeCTAR Dashboard uses\
    \ <a href=\"http://aaf.edu.au/\">Australian Access Federation</a> for its authentication.\n\
    If you have any problems with the login, you can contact the IT helpdesk in your\n\
    local organization or institution. You can log a ticket in the NeCTAR\n<a href=\"\
    https://support.nectar.org.au/support/home\">helpdesk</a>. You can also submit\
    \ a help request to aaf\n<a href=\"http://support.aaf.edu.au/home\">helpdesk</a>\
    \ for help.</p>\n<h2>Debugging API Authentication</h2>\n<p>You must first send\
    \ an authentication request to OpenStack Identity service to\nget an authentication\
    \ token before you can access API services. To request an\nauthentication token,\
    \ you must supply the credentials in the authentication request.</p>\n<p>The credentials\
    \ are a combination of username, password and project name. You also\nneed to\
    \ get the authentication URL for credentials validation.</p>\n<p>You need to make\
    \ sure you have the correct Credentials download from the NeCTAR\nDashboard. Before\
    \ you use them, please check the username, projet name and the\nAPI endpoints.\
    \ You can reference these information from the script file you\nobtained from\
    \ the NeCTAR Dashboard.</p>\n<p>After you send the username/password and project\
    \ name to the authentication URL,\nYou will get a authentication token. Then,\
    \ you need to include the token in the\nX-Auth-Token HTTP header. If you access\
    \ multiple API services, you must get a\ntoken for each API service. The token\
    \ has a limited time and can become invalid\nfor other reasons.</p>\n<h3>Authentication\
    \ and API request workflow</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Send a request with credentials\
    \ to get a token from the Identity endpoint. If\n the request succeeds, the server\
    \ returns an authentication token.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Send API requests and\
    \ include the token in the X-Auth-Token HTTP header. The\n following HTTP requests\
    \ use the same token until the requests complete.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If a 401\
    \ Unauthorized error returned, the request requires a new token.</p>\n</li>\n\
    </ul>\n<h3>Debug Authentication</h3>\n<p>The below use cURL commands to show your\
    \ how to debug authentication request.\nFor information about cURL, see <a href=\"\
    http://curl.haxx.se/\">http://curl.haxx.se/</a>. For information\nabout the OpenStack\
    \ APIs, see <a href=\"http://developer.openstack.org/api-ref.html\">OpenStack\
    \ API Reference</a>.</p>\n<p>To get a valid token, you need 3 parameters:</p>\n\
    <ul>\n<li>\n<p>username</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>password</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>project\
    \ name/project id</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The below shows a code to get token:</p>\n\
    <p>```</p>\n<p>curl -s -X POST https://keystone.rc.nectar.org.au:5000/v2.0/tokens\
    \ \\\n            -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n            -d '{\"\

    '\"}}}' \\\n            | python -m json.tool</p>\n<p>```</p>\n<p>You need to\
    \ replace the username, password and tenantname with the values in\nthe authentication\
    \ script file you obtained from the NeCTAR Dashboard.</p>\n<p>The response would\
    \ look like below:</p>\n<p>```\n{\n    \"access\": {\n        \"metadata\": {\n\
