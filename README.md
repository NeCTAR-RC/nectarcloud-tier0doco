# NeCTAR Cloud Tier 0 Documentation

## How to contribute
To contribute to this project, you will need to understand the following concepts;
- git; the distributed source code management system written by Linus Torvolds.
- github; a 3rd party website which hosts thousands of public git repositories, such as this one
- github flavoured markdown; a way of writing documentation for github
- gerrit code review platform; a Google sponsord code review system.
- email, text editors and other such things.

The purpose of this README is to give you a primer on those systems and allow you to contribute quickly.

### About markdown

This documentation is produced in github flavoured markdown. Markdown is just a way of making plain text appear as structured formatted rich text.  A simple example is by adding a # to the start of a line in markdown, makes that line appear as a heading;

`## The second largest heading (an <h2> tag)`
