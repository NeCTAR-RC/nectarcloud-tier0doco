Project Trials have names like pt-2061. <br>Within your default allocation you \u00a0can run:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>a medium (two core) instance, or</li>\r\n<li>two small (single core) instances.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>As you get near the end of the three month Project Trial, you are encouraged to submit a request for more resources.</p>\r\n<h4>Before submitting a request, increased access via your local node</h4>\r\n<p>If you are associated with one of the <a href=\"http://support.rc.nectar.org.au/node/81\">cloud nodes</a> you may be eligible for access to a local allocation of cloud resource.<br> Speak to your local node about this <b><span>prior</span></b> to submitting a resource request.</p>\r\n<p>Otherwise, your request will be reviewed by the NeCTAR Allocation Committee.</p>\r\n<h4>Submit a Request for more resources</h4>\r\n<p>Use the Allocation Request form from the left hand side menu of the <a href=\"http://support.rc.nectar.org.au/node/54\">dashboard</a>.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au/project/request/\" target=\"_new\">Allocations New Request</a> creates a new project<br> <a href=\"https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au/project/user_requests/\" target=\"_new\">Allocations: My Requests</a> adds resources to an existing project (you will see your previous requests here)</p>\r\n<p>As\r\n a rule of thumb, the more resources you ask for, the more detail we \r\nrequire about your research. Requesting a few cores won\u2019t be scrutinised\r\n as much as requesting tens or hundreds of cores.</p>\r\n<h4>What happens after you submit a request?</h4>\r\n<p>When you submit the request, you will receive a confirmation email with all your details.<br>View or edit your request by clicking on the \u2018My Requests\u2019 tab at the dashboard.<br><br> Your request will be reviewed by the your local node (if any) or the NeCTAR Allocation Committee.<br> This can take up to four weeks to process.<br><br> If there are any issues with your request, we will get in touch with you.<br> You may be asked to provide more detail about your research or to clarify your technical requirements.</p>\r\n<h4>Approved requests become \"Projects\"</h4>\r\n<p>We create a Research Cloud Project using your project name, for example \u2018QCIF DNA Sequencing Project\u2019.<br> You will receive an email confirming everything is ready to go.<br><br> As a user, you can be a member of more than one project.<br> You select the current project to access at the dashboard using a drop down menu on the left hand side.</p>\r\n<h4>Managing an approved Project (Add / remove users)</h4>\r\n<p>Users can be members of multiple Projects sharing each Projects resources with its members.<br> To add other users as members of your Project(s) see <a href=\"http://support.rc.nectar.org.au/node/48\">Managing a Project</a></p>\r\n<h4>How do I increase my existing Projects' resources?</h4>\r\n<p>You can make changes to your request at any time by clicking on \u2018My Requests\u2019 at the dashboard. <br> This will show the requests you have made and you can update them.<br><br> If you change and resubmit the request, it will go through the review process as outlined earlier.</p>\r\n",
