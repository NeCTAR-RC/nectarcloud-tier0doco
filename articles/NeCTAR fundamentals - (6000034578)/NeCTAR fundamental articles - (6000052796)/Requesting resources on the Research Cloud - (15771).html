<p> HUGE CHANGE</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>You can run instances of various sizes on the cloud, from <a href="http://support.rc.nectar.org.au/node/87">one to 16 cores</a>, and from one instance to hundreds.</p>
<h4>Project Trials (Automatic, no application required)</h4>
<p>When you <a href="http://support.rc.nectar.org.au/node/54">log into the cloud</a> for the first time, you are automatically granted a <b>Project Trial</b> Research Allocation of two cores for three months. Project Trials have names like pt-2061. <br>Within your default allocation you  can run:</p>
<ul>
<li>a medium (two core) instance, or</li>
<li>two small (single core) instances.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you get near the end of the three month Project Trial, you are encouraged to submit a request for more resources.</p>
<h4>Before submitting a request, increased access via your local node</h4>
<p>If you are associated with one of the <a href="http://support.rc.nectar.org.au/node/81">cloud nodes</a> you may be eligible for access to a local allocation of cloud resource.<br> Speak to your local node about this <b><span>prior</span></b> to submitting a resource request.</p>
<p>Otherwise, your request will be reviewed by the NeCTAR Allocation Committee.</p>
<h4>Submit a Request for more resources</h4>
<p>Use the Allocation Request form from the left hand side menu of the <a href="http://support.rc.nectar.org.au/node/54">dashboard</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au/project/request/" target="_new">Allocations New Request</a> creates a new project<br> <a href="https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au/project/user_requests/" target="_new">Allocations: My Requests</a> adds resources to an existing project (you will see your previous requests here)</p>
<p>As
 a rule of thumb, the more resources you ask for, the more detail we 
require about your research. Requesting a few cores won’t be scrutinised
 as much as requesting tens or hundreds of cores.</p>
<h4>What happens after you submit a request?</h4>
<p>When you submit the request, you will receive a confirmation email with all your details.<br>View or edit your request by clicking on the ‘My Requests’ tab at the dashboard.<br><br> Your request will be reviewed by the your local node (if any) or the NeCTAR Allocation Committee.<br> This can take up to four weeks to process.<br><br> If there are any issues with your request, we will get in touch with you.<br> You may be asked to provide more detail about your research or to clarify your technical requirements.</p>
<h4>Approved requests become "Projects"</h4>
<p>We create a Research Cloud Project using your project name, for example ‘QCIF DNA Sequencing Project’.<br> You will receive an email confirming everything is ready to go.<br><br> As a user, you can be a member of more than one project.<br> You select the current project to access at the dashboard using a drop down menu on the left hand side.</p>
<h4>Managing an approved Project (Add / remove users)</h4>
<p>Users can be members of multiple Projects sharing each Projects resources with its members.<br> To add other users as members of your Project(s) see <a href="http://support.rc.nectar.org.au/node/48">Managing a Project</a></p>
<h4>How do I increase my existing Projects' resources?</h4>
<p>You can make changes to your request at any time by clicking on ‘My Requests’ at the dashboard. <br> This will show the requests you have made and you can update them.<br><br> If you change and resubmit the request, it will go through the review process as outlined earlier.</p>
