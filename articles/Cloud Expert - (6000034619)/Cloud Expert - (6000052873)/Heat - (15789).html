<p>Heat is a template driven service that automates the management of the entire lifecycle of your application on the NeCTAR cloud.</p>
<p>A
 'template driven service' simply means that you define your 
application's requirements in a human readable text file - the template.
 In this file you to describe both the infrastructure and its 
relationships that your application will need to run on the NeCTAR 
cloud.</p>
<p>Heat then uses this template to provision the required 
infrastructure and manage the lifecycle of your application from start 
to finish. This template, and the infrastructure that it has created, is
 termed a 'stack'.</p>
<p>As part of the life cycle management, the Heat 
service supports both scaling on demand and the freeing up of 
infrastructure once the application is finished.</p>
<p>Heat integrates 
well with configuration management tools, such as Chef and Puppet. Thus 
the Heat service offers executable documentation of your application's 
deployment and lifecycle, making your deployments repeatable and 
reliable. The net effect is to limit human error and to save you time. 
Thus saving you money.</p>
<h2>The stack template format(s)</h2>
<p>Heat is modelled after Amazon's <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html?r=7078">CloudFormation</a>
 service, and endeavours to maintain some degree of comparability with 
this service. Hence Heat supports two different template formats.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first is a <a href="http://www.json.org/">JSON</a> based implementation that mimics the Amazon specification.</li>
<li>The second is a <a href="http://www.yaml.org/">YAML</a> based native OpenStack implementation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The stack lifecycle</h2>
<p>A template is created, using a standard text editor (such as <a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a>).
 It is then uploaded into the OpenStack Heat service, either by means of
 the Heat command line client, or the Horizon dashboard.</p>
<p>If 
uploaded via the command line client, the engine expects any mandatory 
parameters to be provided as arguments added at the point the template 
was uploaded.</p>
<p>If, however, uploaded via the dashboard, then the 
dashboard will create an input wizard that will step the person who 
uploaded the template through the process of entering the required 
parameter values.</p>
<p>Once all the required data has been gathered the stack is then provisioned and launched.</p>
<p>The
 template and its associated parameters will remain in the Heat database
 until such time as the engine is instructed to destroy the stack.</p>
<p>At
 that point all the provisioned infrastructure will be destroyed, its 
resources released, and then the template and its parameters will be 
removed from the Heat database.</p>
<p>We have created a screencast that that does a walk through of this lifecycle: <a href="http://support.rc.nectar.org.au/node/210">Heat: a screencast</a>.</p>

<h2>Known issues</h2>
<p><b><span style="font-size: 1.231em;">Restricted resources</span></b></p>
<p>Only OpenStack admins can currently make use of the following resources:</p>

<p>This is a <a title="bug 1089261" href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/heat/+bug/1089261" target="_self">known issue</a> and should be resolved in the next release of OpenStack.</p>
<h3>No root certificates message</h3>
<p>If you get an error stating that "<i>No root certificates specified for verification of other-side certificates</i>" when using the command line then the work around is to use the --insecure flag:</p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">heat --insecure stack-list</span></p>
<p>This
 stops the server's certificate from being verified against any 
certficate authority. Not the greatest solution, but a solution for the 
time being.</p>
