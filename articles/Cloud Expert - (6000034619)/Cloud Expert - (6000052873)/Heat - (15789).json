    "description": "<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Heat is a template driven service that automates the management of the entire lifecycle of your application on the NeCTAR cloud.</p>\n<p>A\r\n 'template driven service' simply means that you define your \r\napplication's requirements in a human readable text file - the template.\r\n In this file you to describe both the infrastructure and its \r\nrelationships that your application will need to run on the NeCTAR \r\ncloud.</p>\n<p>Heat then uses this template to provision the required \r\ninfrastructure and manage the lifecycle of your application from start \r\nto finish. This template, and the infrastructure that it has created, is\r\n termed a 'stack'.</p>\n<p>As part of the life cycle management, the Heat \r\nservice supports both scaling on demand and the freeing up of \r\ninfrastructure once the application is finished.</p>\n<p>Heat integrates \r\nwell with configuration management tools, such as Chef and Puppet. Thus \r\nthe Heat service offers executable documentation of your application's \r\ndeployment and lifecycle, making your deployments repeatable and \r\nreliable. The net effect is to limit human error and to save you time. \r\nThus saving you money.</p>\n<h2>The stack template format(s)</h2>\n<p>Heat is modelled after Amazon's <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html?r=7078\">CloudFormation</a>\r\n service, and endeavours to maintain some degree of comparability with \r\nthis service. Hence Heat supports two different template formats.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The first is a <a href=\"http://www.json.org/\">JSON</a> based implementation that mimics the Amazon specification.</li>\n<li>The second is a <a href=\"http://www.yaml.org/\">YAML</a> based native OpenStack implementation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The stack lifecycle</h2>\n<p>A template is created, using a standard text editor (such as <a href=\"http://notepad-plus-plus.org/\">Notepad++</a>).\r\n It is then uploaded into the OpenStack Heat service, either by means of\r\n the Heat command line client, or the Horizon dashboard.</p>\n<p>If \r\nuploaded via the command line client, the engine expects any mandatory \r\nparameters to be provided as arguments added at the point the template \r\nwas uploaded.</p>\n<p>If, however, uploaded via the dashboard, then the \r\ndashboard will create an input wizard that will step the person who \r\nuploaded the template through the process of entering the required \r\nparameter values.</p>\n<p>Once all the required data has been gathered the stack is then provisioned and launched.</p>\n<p>The\r\n template and its associated parameters will remain in the Heat database\r\n until such time as the engine is instructed to destroy the stack.</p>\n<p>At\r\n that point all the provisioned infrastructure will be destroyed, its \r\nresources released, and then the template and its parameters will be \r\nremoved from the Heat database.</p>\n<p>We have created a screencast that that does a walk through of this lifecycle: <a href=\"http://support.rc.nectar.org.au/node/210\">Heat: a screencast</a>.</p>\n<h2>More information</h2>\n<p>The following pages offer more in depth technical information on using Heat in the NeCTAR cloud.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://support.rc.nectar.org.au/node/159\">Heat: enough YAML to read a template</a>\u00a0(usefull if you don't know YAML)</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://support.rc.nectar.org.au/node/162\">Heat: walk through of a YAML template</a> - a walk through of a Heat template that is in use on the NeCTAR cloud.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://support.rc.nectar.org.au/node/171\">Heat: actions that can be performed</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://support.rc.nectar.org.au/node/186\">Heat: the command line client</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://support.rc.nectar.org.au/node/189\">Heat: the dashboard</a></li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://support.rc.nectar.org.au/node/180\">Heat: preparing your images</a> - you need more than just cloud-init!</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://support.rc.nectar.org.au/node/174\">Heat: good practices</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://support.rc.nectar.org.au/node/177\">Heat: debugging</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://support.rc.nectar.org.au/node/168\">Heat: oddities and gotcha's</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://support.rc.nectar.org.au/node/213\">Heat: supported resources</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Further links</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a title=\"Sample Templates\" href=\"https://github.com/NeCTAR-RC/heat-templates\" target=\"_self\">NeCTAR sample templates</a> -\u00a0 a set of templates that have been run against the NeCTAR cloud.</li>\n<li>The OpenStack dashboard manual <a href=\"http://docs.openstack.org/user-guide/content/dashboard_stacks.html\">Heat page</a>.</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Heat\">Heat wiki</a>\n</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"http://docs.openstack.org/developer/heat/template_guide/\">Heat template guide</a>\n</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"http://docs.openstack.org/user-guide/content/heat_client_commands.html\">command line client</a>\n</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"http://support.rc.nectar.org.au/node/255\">Tech Talk</a> on Heat</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Known issues</h2>\n<p><b><span style=\"font-size: 1.231em;\">Restricted resources</span></b></p>\n<p>Only OpenStack admins can currently make use of the following resources:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>AWS::CloudFormation::WaitConditionHandle</li>\n<li>OS::Heat::HARestarter</li>\n<li>AWS::AutoScaling::ScalingPolicy</li>\n<li>AWS::IAM::User</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is a <a title=\"bug 1089261\" href=\"https://bugs.launchpad.net/heat/+bug/1089261\" target=\"_self\">known issue</a> and should be resolved in the next release of OpenStack.</p>\n<h3>No root certificates message</h3>\n<p>If you get an error stating that \"<i>No root certificates specified for verification of other-side certificates</i>\" when using the command line then the work around is to use the --insecure flag:</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: courier new,courier;\">heat --insecure stack-list</span></p>\n<p>This\r\n stops the server's certificate from being verified against any \r\ncertficate authority.
