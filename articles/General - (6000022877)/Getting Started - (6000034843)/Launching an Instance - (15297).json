(for more details check the <a href=\"https://wiki.rc.nectar.org.au/wiki/Image_Catalog\">Image Catalog</a>)<br> Select an Image and click \"launch\".<br> You will see the launch page.</p>\n<h4>Configure the instance</h4>\n<p><span>Fill in some or all options:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Server Name: your choice of name for the instance for easy reference</span></li>\n<li>\n<span>User Data: Information that will be made available to your instance through the </span><a href=\"http://support.rc.nectar.org.au/node/72\">Metadata Interface</a>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span>Flavour: the size of the hardware to use (see Instances</span><a href=\"http://support.rc.nectar.org.au/node/87\"> Available by Size</a><span>)</span>\n</li>\n<li><span>Your allocated flavour or lesser configurations can be selected (the default is m1.small a 1 CPU machine)</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<span>Key Name: is an SSH KeyPair used to access your instance, create them via the </span><span>Access &amp; Security Tab (see <a href=\"http://support.rc.nectar.org.au/node/153\">KeyPairs</a>)</span>\n</li>\n<li><span><a href=\"http://support.rc.nectar.org.au/node/117\">Security Groups</a>: Add Network Access to your instances.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul><li>\n<span>The default </span><span>Security Group</span><span> (no network access at first) is pre-selected.</span>\n</li></ul>\n<p><span>The default Security Group can have access rules added to it later if necessary, or</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<span>Create and modify groups via the </span><a href=\"http://support.rc.nectar.org.au/node/117\">Security Groups</a><span> tab</span>\n</li>\n<li><span>Changes: add/edit access rules to any applied Security Group even after launching.</span></li>\n<li><span>Changes immediately apply to all instances using the Security Group.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Launch Instance</h4>\n<p><span>The\r\n Launch Instance button begins Cloud provisioning and initialisation of a\r\n running instance from the selected image and your configuration \r\noptions. The Instance will normally pass from Status \"Build\" to \r\n\"Active\". Depending on your image size and cloud activity the length of \r\ntime required may vary, refresh your browser to see the status change. \r\nYour instance will have a public IP address and be reachable according \r\nto the Security Groups selected.</span></p>\n<p><span>Connect to your new instance via\u00a0</span><a href=\"http://support.rc.nectar.org.au/node/114\">ssh or other methods listed here</a></p>\n<h4>If your Launch is unsuccessful</h4>\n<p><span>You\r\n may get a message that you your quota has been exceeded or you have \r\ninsufficient resources. Check the table to the right on the Launch \r\nInstance page it lists the number of instances you may run \r\nsimultaneously, then check the\u00a0</span>Instances tab\u00a0to see how many \r\nInstances you already have running. You may have to terminate a running \r\nInstance to free resources before you can launch another (see Instance \r\ntab\u00a0to Terminate). If you need more resources see the\u00a0<a href=\"http://support.rc.nectar.org.au/node/27\">allocation tab</a>\u00a0to apply for an increase.</p>\n</div>\r\n  <p><br></p>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\r\n",
