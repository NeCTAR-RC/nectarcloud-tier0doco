HUGE CHANGE

  

You can run instances of various sizes on the cloud, from [one to 16
cores](http://support.rc.nectar.org.au/node/87), and from one instance to
hundreds.

#### Project Trials (Automatic, no application required)

When you [log into the cloud](http://support.rc.nectar.org.au/node/54) for the
first time, you are automatically granted a **Project Trial** Research
Allocation of two cores for three months. Project Trials have names like
pt-2061.  
Within your default allocation you can run:

  * a medium (two core) instance, or
  * two small (single core) instances.

As you get near the end of the three month Project Trial, you are encouraged
to submit a request for more resources.

#### Before submitting a request, increased access via your local node

If you are associated with one of the [cloud
nodes](http://support.rc.nectar.org.au/node/81) you may be eligible for access
to a local allocation of cloud resource.  
Speak to your local node about this **prior** to submitting a resource
request.

Otherwise, your request will be reviewed by the NeCTAR Allocation Committee.

#### Submit a Request for more resources

Use the Allocation Request form from the left hand side menu of the
[dashboard](http://support.rc.nectar.org.au/node/54).

[Allocations New Request](https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au/project/request/)
creates a new project  
[Allocations: My
Requests](https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au/project/user_requests/) adds
resources to an existing project (you will see your previous requests here)

As a rule of thumb, the more resources you ask for, the more detail we require
about your research. Requesting a few cores won’t be scrutinised as much as
requesting tens or hundreds of cores.

#### What happens after you submit a request?

When you submit the request, you will receive a confirmation email with all
your details.  
View or edit your request by clicking on the ‘My Requests’ tab at the
dashboard.  
  
Your request will be reviewed by the your local node (if any) or the NeCTAR
Allocation Committee.  
This can take up to four weeks to process.  
  
If there are any issues with your request, we will get in touch with you.  
You may be asked to provide more detail about your research or to clarify your
technical requirements.

#### Approved requests become "Projects"

We create a Research Cloud Project using your project name, for example ‘QCIF
DNA Sequencing Project’.  
You will receive an email confirming everything is ready to go.  
  
As a user, you can be a member of more than one project.  
You select the current project to access at the dashboard using a drop down
menu on the left hand side.

#### Managing an approved Project (Add / remove users)

Users can be members of multiple Projects sharing each Projects resources with
its members.  
To add other users as members of your Project(s) see [Managing a
Project](http://support.rc.nectar.org.au/node/48)

#### How do I increase my existing Projects' resources?

You can make changes to your request at any time by clicking on ‘My Requests’
at the dashboard.  
This will show the requests you have made and you can update them.  
  
If you change and resubmit the request, it will go through the review process
as outlined earlier.
