## Introduction <a name="intro"></a>

### Description 

Since cloud Virtual Machine (VM) images are restricted in size, it is not possible to have a generic image containing all the different application software that is available on high-performance computing (HPC) systems, such as eResearchSA's [Tizard supercomputer][tizard]. Users have therefore needed to find VM images that contain the software they need, or install it themselves. 

[eResearchSA][ersa] has deployed a distributed software repository that enables cloud virtual machines to easily access all the software applications that are available on the Tizard supercomputer. Users can run any of this software on the cloud virtual machine, just as they can on Tizard.

This service is designed for:

- Researchers who want to use cloud virtual machines to run compute-intensive software applications
- Situations where a single virtual machine image containing all the required software is not available, and the researcher does not want to install the software themselves.
- This service is currently only available for South Australian users as it uses the SA software repository.

### CVMFS 

The system makes use of a read-only, http-based distributed virtual file system called the [CERN VM File System][cern] (CVMFS), which CERN developed to enable researchers to access their standard software packages at many sites around the world. eRSA has set up a CVMFS server that provides access to a repository of all the open-source software that is installed on eRSA's HPC systems, and a NeCTAR cloud virtual machine image that contains a CVMFS client that can access the software in the repository. 

When a user runs a software application on the cloud virtual machine, the software is automatically downloaded from the CVMFS repository and stored locally on the VM. The next time the same software is used, CVMFS uses the local copy of the software so it will start up faster, without having to wait for the download.

For the user, this all happens transparently, it appears as though all the application software is installed on the cloud virtual machine.

## Getting a Project Allocation

Researchers will by default have a trial allocation on NeCTAR (project name pt-XXXXX; 2 cores for 3 months).

You will need to request a project allocation for further resources if:

-  you require more computing power or longer term usage
-  you wish to share cloud computing resources with your research group

Log in to the [NeCTAR dashboard][dashboardalloc] and click on **New Request** under **Allocations** in the left hand side menu. Email the [eRSA Helpdesk](mailto:servicedesk@ersa.edu.au) if you have questions about any of the information in the form. New requests can take a couple of weeks to process, and allocations are merit-based.

## Contact eRSA to help set-up your instance

Accessing the Cloud software repository is as simple as launching an instance using a specific image designed by eRSA staff, and knowing a few [basic commands](#modules).  

Email the [eRSA Helpdesk](mailto:servicedesk@ersa.edu.au) to inform them you want to set up a VM with access to the software repository, and a support member will give you the name of the current image that you will use.  You can use this information to launch an instance, following the instructions below, or you can request that eRSA set up the VM for you.

### Add your eRSA support contact to your project users group

After you have received a project allocation, you can add collaborators as users to the project by selecting the [Users][users] tab in the project menu on the dashboard and entering the institutional ([AAF][aaf]) email address of your co-workers.

It is recommended that you add the eRSA email address of your eRSA support contact to the users of your project. If you need any assistance in setting up or managing your VM, eRSA staff will need to be a user on the project in order to provide some types of assistance.

## Creating a security group

-  If you have not already done so, you will need to create a security group with port 22 open for SSH access. 

-  On the NeCTAR [dashboard][dashboardsec], ensure you are in the correct project.

  ![](images/software_choose_project.png)

-  Select "Access & Security" under the left hand side pane under "Compute".
-  ![](images/software_createsecuritybutton.png) Select the "Create Security Group" button near the top right corner
-  Give your security group a name and description and click the "Create Security Group" button
-  Click "Manage Rules" in the "Actions" drop-down menu
-  ![](images/software_addrulebutton.png) Click on the "Add Rule" button near the top right corner 

-  A small window should pop up. Make sure the "Rule" is set to "Custom TCP Rule" 
  and "Open Port" is set to "Port". Under the Port textbox enter "**22**". Set "Remote" 
  to "CIDR" and under the "CIDR" textbox enter one of the following IP ranges as appropriate.
    - 129.127.0.0/16 - University of Adelaide
    - 129.96.0.0/16 - Flinders
    - 130.220.0.0/16 - UniSA  
-  E.g. for a user from the University of Adelaide:

## Creating an instance with access to the software repository

See this [training module][train] or this [guide][launch] for detailed instructions on launching an instance if it is your first time and/or you haven't yet set up SSH keypairs.

-  In your project allocation on the NeCTAR [dashboard][instance], navigate to the 'Instances' tab in the 'Compute' menu.

-  ![](images/software_launchInstance_button.png) Select the "Launch Instance" button near the top right corner

-  Fill in a name for the VM, choose an appropriate size (Flavor), then select the image name provided by eRSA (the screenshot shows the image used for CVMFS access at the time of writing this document).

  ![](images/software_launchInstance.png)

-  Click the 'Access and Security' tab. Select your SSH keypair and select the security group which allows access through port 22 for SSH (set up in the previous step).

  ![](images/software_access_security.png)

-  Click the 'Availability Zone' tab and select '**sa**', Then click '**Launch**'

  ![](images/software_avail_zone.png)

-  Once the Instance is running, use the IP Address to connect to the VM via SSH in the usual way, as outlined in the [Accessing Instances][access] support page and the training module [Launching and Connecting][connect].

## Loading the pre-installed software packages  

There are a few simple commands to find software packages in the repository and load them on your VM.

| Command  | Action |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `module --help` | help page for the 'module' commands |
| `module avail` | list all available packages in the repository |
| `module avail <search term>` | list package names containing the search term |
| `module list` | list the packages that are already loaded on the VM |
| `module show <name>` | show info on the package, and lists the dependencies - required modules that need to be loaded before you can load the package of interest |
| `module load <name>` | load the package onto the VM |
| `module unload <name>` | remove the package 'cache' from the VM |

An example of loading the package 'Stacks'.

<a name="transferfiles"></a>

## Sharing files with the virtual machine  

There is a [training module][copy] and a [support guide][transfer] with comprehensive details on transferring data between your VM and your local computer or remote storage servers. Using programs like FileZilla or WinSCP is an easy method of transferring data from your local computer. 

The following information outlines commands that can be entered on your VM in order to transfer data to and from remote data storage, such as the [storage][storage] offered by eRSA. 

## Secure Copy (SCP) between the VM and a data storage server


If you have data stored on a remote server, you can transfer files between it and the VM through the command-line on the VM.

You will need a host address for the data storage server, your username, and your password.

`scp <source> <destination>`

-  To download to the VM : `scp <remote computer>:<path to file> <local VM path>`  
-  To upload to data storage : `scp <local VM path> <remote computer>:<path to file>`

`scp username@sftp.ersa.edu.au:/data/myDirectory/file.txt /mnt/data/`  
`scp /mnt/data/results.zip username@sftp.ersa.edu.au:/data/myDirectory/`

You will usually then be prompted to enter the password for your data storage.

  ![](images/software_scp_demo.png)


## SFTP via the Command Line 

Secure file transfer is also available between the VM and remote data storage.

Enter the 'sftp' command on your VM, and you will have access to the remote host.

`sftp username@host.address.edu.au   `   - you will be prompted for a password.


You are now accessing the remote data storage server, and you can navigate the files on the server as per usual with commands like `cd` and `ls`.

The commands `get` and `put` will transfer data between the machines:

`get <remote_server_file.txt> </mnt/localVM_destination/>`

`put </mnt/localVM_destination/file.txt> <remote_directory/>`

to close the sftp connection, type `exit`.

## The CentOS operating system

The VM image that allows access to the CVMFS software repository is a Linux distribution called CentOS. Most of the documentation available about using your Linux VM assumes that you have an Ubuntu operating system.  There is very little difference for the user between these Linux operating systems, but there is one main difference to be aware of.

CentOS uses the package manager '**yum**' instead of '**apt-get**'. If you need to install packages on your VM that aren't in the CVMFS software repository, you need to use the 'yum' command wherever there would be an 'apt-get' command in Ubuntu. e.g.

- `yum search <package name>`
- `sudo yum install <package name>`
- `sudo yum update`

**ERSA**
> eResearch SA runs the South Australian node of the NeCTAR research cloud.

**Flavor**
> An OpenStack term for an instance sizing specification. Gives the amount 
> of memory, number of VCPUs and ephemeral disc size.

**Image**
> An image (or system image) is a copy of the entire state of a computer system 
> saved as a file. Images are used in two ways in NeCTAR. Firstly as a template for 
> Virtual Machines (VMs). You can launch a VM based on an image. 
> The second use of images is to preserve the state of a VM as configured by you as end user. 
> This type of image is usually referred to as a snapshot.

**Instance**
> An instance is a VM hosted on the NeCTAR OpenStack infrastructure.

**Project**
> The NeCTAR term for a "resource container"; i.e. what you get when you 
> are granted a NeCTAR allocation. A project "owns" virtual machine instances, snapshots 
> and various kinds of storage, and may be shared by multiple users.

**Security Group**
> A set of access rules that may be applied to one or more instances. 
> An access rule allows network access to an instance from other hosts with a 
> specified combination of protocol family (e.g. TCP, UDP, UCMP), port number and address range. [Security Groups page][security]

**Virtual Machine**
> A virtual machine (VM) is an operating system (OS) or application environment that 
> is installed on software which imitates dedicated hardware. The end user has the same 
> experience on a virtual machine as they would have on dedicated hardware.

**Volume Storage**
> Data Storage in your Virtual Machine that works like a hard-drive on your PC or 
> laptop does. Volume storage is automatically available in your VM as the storage 
> space for you system drive. Some flavors of VMs include an amount of ephemeral volume 
> storage. Depending on your allocation you can have persistent volume storage attached to your VM.
