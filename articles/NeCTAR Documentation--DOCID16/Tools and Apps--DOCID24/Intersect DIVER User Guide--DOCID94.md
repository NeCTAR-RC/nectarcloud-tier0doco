# Intersect DIVER User Guide

## Description

DIVER (Data Is Vital for Empirical Research) is a general purpose, user-friendly research data capture and sharing application.

DIVER is a full lifecycle research data management solution, developed by Intersect for the University of Western Sydney Hawkesbury Institute for the Environment (HIE). 

DIVER is particularly beneficial where the researcher needs to quickly organize and share their file-based data locally or with an international community. DIVER provides functionality beyond traditional organisational file shares addressing contemporary research needs such as data provenance and lifecycle management, data access management, management of metadata, data citation and reproducibility of research.

## Audience

DIVER is Open Source software and as such is available to all researchers at no cost.

Intersect Australia has experience in assisting researchers/research groups to establish a DIVER instance through its Software Engineering capability. Hosted solutions may also be managed by Intersect where required. 

## How to deploy DIVER

The latest version of DIVER is available through [Launchpod][launchpod], a tool to deploy preconfigured virtual machines (VMs) on the [NeCTAR Research Cloud][nectarrc]. Please read the [Launchpod user guide][launchpod-doc] for more information about how to use it to deploy an instance of DIVER.

For more detailed discussion on the potential to deploy DIVER within an Intersect member institution, contact your university's [eResearch Analyst][eras].

Alternatively, you can [contact Intersect][enquiries] to enquire about a managed DIVER instance for your university or project. 

## How to use DIVER

Intersect maintains a comprehensive [User Manual][diver-user-manual] for DIVER, which covers everything you need to know about installing, managing and using this tool.

For queries in using DIVER in an institutional environment, please [contact Intersect][enquiries].

## What else do I need to know about DIVER

DIVER is Australian Access Federation (AAF) enabled, meaning that users can connect to the system using their institutional username and password. 

DIVER has been under continuous development by Intersect for a variety of different research disciplines.

There is a [community][diver-group] of DIVER users that communicates via Google Groups to discuss suggestions for new features as well as ways in which DIVER is being used.
