## Quick reference for shell commands in the Cloud Basics articles

Although you can set up your VM with a remote desktop (see the NeCTAR Training modules),
the most efficient way to use your linux VM is by command-line.

There are some excellent tutorials for basic shell commands (also called unix or bash commands).
[Codecademy][codecademy] offers an excellent, free, interactive tutorial that you can complete within your browser on any operating system.

You may also like to print off a cheatsheet of shell commands, such as this [simple one page sheet][simple],
or one of these more thorough references: [Learncodethehardway][long] or [GitHubGist][git]

Here are some particular commands used in the Cloud Basics articles, for quick reference.
