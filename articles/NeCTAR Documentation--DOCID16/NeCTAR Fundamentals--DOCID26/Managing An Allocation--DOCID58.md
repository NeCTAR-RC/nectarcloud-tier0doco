# Requesting resources on the Research Cloud

You can run instances of various sizes on the cloud, from one to 16 cores, and
from one instance to hundreds.

## Project Trials (Automatic, no application required)

When you log into the cloud for the first time, you are automatically granted a
Project Trial Research Allocation of two cores for three months. Project Trials
have names like pt-2061.

Within your default allocation you can run:

- a medium (two core) instance, or
- two small (single core) instances.
- As you get near the end of Project Trial, submit a request for more resources.

## Before submitting a request, increased access via your local node

If you are associated with one of the cloud nodes you may be eligible for
access to a local allocation of cloud resource.  Speak to your local node about
this prior to submitting a resource request.

Otherwise, your request will be reviewed by the NeCTAR Allocation Committee.

## Submit a Request for more resources

To request access to more Nectar Cloud resources, you fill in a new request
or you amend/extend one of your existing requests

Use the Allocation Request form from the left hand side menu of the dashboard.

1. Login to the Nectar dashboard at [https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au](https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au)
1. On the left hand side, click "Allocations"
1. If you're requesting a New Allocation, click "New Request"
   Or
   If you're amending/extending an existing project, navigate to My Requests and
   click the Amend/Extend allocation button on the right, next to your project
1. On the Request Form, you're asked to fill in or adjust some details about
   your research project.
1. Click the "Submit" button.

As a rule of thumb, the more resources you ask for, the more detail we require
about your research. Requesting a few cores won’t be scrutinised as much as
requesting tens or hundreds of cores.

## What happens after you submit a request

When you submit the request, you will receive a confirmation email with all
your details.  View or edit your request by clicking on the ‘My Requests’ tab
at the dashboard.

Your request will be reviewed by your local node (if any) or the NeCTAR
Allocation Committee.  This can take up to four weeks to process.

If there are any issues with your request, we will get in touch with you.  You
may be asked to provide more detail about your research or to clarify your
technical requirements.

## Approved requests become "Projects"

We create a Research Cloud Project using your project name, for example ‘QCIF
DNA Sequencing Project’.  You will receive an email confirming everything is
ready to go.

As a user, you can be a member of more than one project.  You select the
current project to access at the dashboard using a drop down menu on the left
hand side.

## Managing an approved Project (Add / remove users)

Users can be members of multiple Projects sharing each Projects resources with
its members.  To add other users as members of your Project(s) see Managing a
Project

## How do I increase my existing Projects' resources

You can make changes to your request at any time by clicking on ‘My Requests’
at the dashboard.  This will show the requests you have made and you can update
them.

If you change and resubmit the request, it will go through the review process
as outlined earlier.
